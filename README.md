	- This graph is a [[Digital Garden]] which means:
		- It is highly [[dynamic]] and subject to change.
		- It's structure is [[decentralized]], [[bottom-up]] and [[emergent]].
		- [[Pages]] are often empty, but that doesn't mean they're useless- check out a pages [[Linked References]] to find any other time the page is mentioned
		- It is easy to wander around and get lost, which is kind of the point...
	- Feel free to follow any of the [[links]] to start exploring
