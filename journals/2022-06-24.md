	- [[IPFS]] which would be really good for [[distributed]] [[graphs]] [as mentioned here](https://discuss.logseq.com/t/specification-for-public-graph-discovery-decentralized-social-network-on-logseq/8067/10)
		- [IPFS Powers the Distributed Web](https://ipfs.io/#how) #Highlights
			- When you add a file to IPFS, your file is split into smaller chunks, cryptographically hashed, and given a **unique fingerprint** called a [content identifier](https://proto.school/anatomy-of-a-cid) (CID). This CID acts as a permanent record of your file as it exists at that point in time.
			- When other nodes **look up your file**, they ask their peer nodes who's storing the content referenced by the file's CID. When they view or download your file, they cache a copy — and become another provider of your content until their cache is cleared.
			- A node can [pin content](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/persistence/) in order to keep (and provide) it forever, or discard content it hasn't used in a while to save space. This means each node in the network **stores only content it is interested in**, plus some indexing information that helps figure out which node is storing what.
			- If you add a new version of your file to IPFS, its cryptographic hash is different, and so it gets a new CID.
			- However, this doesn't mean you need to remember a long string of CIDs — IPFS can find the latest version of your file using the [IPNS](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/ipns/) decentralized naming system, and [DNSLink](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/dnslink/) can be used to map CIDs to **human-readable DNS names**.

		- [Introduction | Matrix.org](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/introduction)
			- Matrix is an **open standard** for **interoperable**, **decentralised**, **real-time** communication over IP.
				- there exists an **open standard** in the form of the [Matrix Specification](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/)
				- it's ** [[interoperable]] **, meaning it is designed to __interoperate__ with other communication systems, and being an Open Standard means it's easy to see how to interoperate with it
				- Matrix is **decentralised**, which means there is __no central point__ - anyone can host their own server and have control over their data
				- it is designed to function in **real-time**, which means it is ideal for building systems that require immediate exchange of data, such as Instant Messaging
