A **blockchain** is a growing list of [records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_(computer_science)), called blocks, that are linked together using [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography).[(1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-fortune20160515-1) [(2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-nyt20160521-2) [(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-te20151031-3) [(4)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-cryptocurrencytech-4) It's also described as a "trustless and fully [decentralized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization) [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) [immutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object) [data storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_storage)" that is spread over a [network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network) of participants often referred to as [nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking)).[(5)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKnirschUnterwegerEngel20192-5) Each block contains a [cryptographic hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) of the previous block, a [timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_timestamping), and transaction data (generally represented as a [Merkle tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree)). The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was published in order to get into its hash. As blocks each contain information about the block previous to it, they form a chain, with each additional block reinforcing the ones before it. Therefore, blockchains are resistant to modification of their data because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.
