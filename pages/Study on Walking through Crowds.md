Read an interesting [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/science/distracted-walking-phone.html?surface=home-discovery-vi-prg&fellback=false&req_id=55557076&algo=identity&variant=no-exp&imp_id=840022511&action=click&module=Science%20%20Technology&pgtype=Homepage) about [[crowds]] and [[Walking]] - humans naturally form lanes when walking and they use their gaze to both detect where to move but also to broadcast their movements. When someone is on their phone and walking and at the front they are likely to not form lanes as easily and slow down the creation of lanes by the people behind them. This is an intersting example of [[Emergence]]
