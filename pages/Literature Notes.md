In the [[Zettlekasten]] Work Flow there is the concept of a literature note.
A literature note should:
- Come FROM your fleeting notes.
- Be written in your own words.
- Contain one idea per note.
- Be easily understandable in the future.

Somebody Suggests that it's good practice to go through your [[Fleeting Notes]] at the end of the day and turn them into Literature Notes. You can then turn those into [[Permanent Notes]].
