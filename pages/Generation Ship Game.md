In the Generations game two teams are working to communicate and solve generational challenges across vast distances. The object of the game is to find each other in the vastness of space.

Each team consists of players living on a generational starship. They are trying to slowly travel across space to find each other.

# Setup
Divide players into 2 teams. Seperate these teams into two spaces.
On each team pick 2 people who will start off as "awake" and have the rest of the players put themselves into cryosleep
Cryosleep can mean many differnt things- what is important is that they are isolated from the alive players and can neither hear them nor see them.

The awake players then draw an objective deck- this is your current goal for interacting with the other ship. These goals are:
- Make contact: find them in the vastness of space
- Search and Destroy: find the enemy vessle, lure them into a trap and destroy them
- *Take Me to your leader- get them to take you to the home world?
-  Science

Objectives function like rock paper sciscors- there is a prep that needs to be done on the ship to activate it for each phase

# Actions
## Craft a Message
When taking the craft a message action you may add one new word to the message or change one word in the existing message

## Send a message
If you think it's ready to be sent, send the message

## Plot a course
Change the destination of the ship on the grid

## Change the objective
Pick a new objective from the deck

## Prep the Ship
 Lasers can be set to active or inactive
 Broadcasts can be set to hostile or friendly
Defenses can be set to shields or Tractor beam

## Consult the Computer
You can consult the ships logs to see what previous generations have done
You can erase the logs

Change the actions- when the objective changes different things become visible

Computer clearance overide- manually hide or reveal different actions. Like going to war opens up weapons development and training, where as 

## Wake someone from cryosleep
You may wake someone up from cryosleep. You may also use this action to catch people up

# Gameplay
Upon waking up from cryo sleep you may take 5 actions
At the end of your 5th action you die and become another crew member in cryo sleep.

When the two ships meet resolve each in the manner of rock paper sciscors:

Double combat is loose loose.
