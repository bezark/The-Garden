I guess [[Democracy]] is a really fragile entity. It's power is emergent and it relies on participation from several key areas. Namely:
- The People
- The Legislators
- The Justice
- The Military
- The Media

Probably more. But if any of these institutions works to subvert the efforts of Democracy it can easily be done.
