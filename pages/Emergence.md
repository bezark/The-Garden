Bottom up. Step back and  look. From Wikipedia:

> In philosophy, systems theory, science, and art, **Emergence** occurs when an entity is observed to have properties its parts do not have on their own, properties or behaviors which emerge only when the parts interact in a wider whole.
>
> Emergence plays a central role in theories of integrative levels and of complex systems. For instance, the phenomenon of life as studied in biology is an emergent property of chemistry, and many psychological phenomena are known to emerge from underlying neurobiological processes.
>
> In philosophy, theories that emphasize emergent properties have been called emergentism. [^1]
