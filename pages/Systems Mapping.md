Workshop from [[Prediction As Planning]]
**Systems Mapping Workshop Instructions**
# __STEP ONE: Framing your system__

## Task: Developing a shared mental model
### (15 mins) __Generative Thinking __

Spend 15 minutes as a group discussing ways to frame a problem statement within your meta-system. You can use stickies to capture words/phrases/ideas that keep coming up. Thought-starters could include any problematic results of unknown (or poorly understood) system dynamics; places where the future is particularly disputed or uncertain; issues where a problematic future result seems “inevitable”; etc.

### (10 mins) __Narrow & Refine to a central problem statement__
The top-line task here is to agree on a central problem framing.
Ways to get to a shared central statement might include thinking about who is most impacted by the various problems identified -- can you frame a central problem that is having the biggest impact on these stakeholders (or will in the future)?
Remember, you may iterate as you continue mapping to go broader or narrower on your system, or to revise initial assumptions, so don’t worry about getting it just right now. Your starting problem statement might be very broad (i.e., millions of people are being diagnosed with a preventable disease) or very narrow (i.e., 30% of patients are dropping off of treatment in the first three months).

Signs you have landed on a good central statement:
    - The complexity of the problem makes it difficult to untangle cause and effect and identify effective solutions
    - Collective actions are needed from multiple stakeholders to shift the system
    - Dynamics in the overall system are replicated in subsystems

Put your shared central problem on a sticky in the middle of a large blank sheet of paper.
 
 ## **Task: Developing a domain diagram**
### (15 mins) __Structures and borders__
### (10 mins) __Chunking__
Come to consensus about the key assumptions, system dynamics, system behaviors or “results,” and system elements that you want to better understand through mapping. Label these on stickies and start arranging them around your central problem statement.

Keep going until break time (7:50 or earlier, TBD)
# __STEP TWO: Mapping your system__
## **Task: Generative Thinking**
List on stickies: __Results, Roles, Relationships, Rules and Resources__
See the table on the next page if you get stuck or want some thought-starters.

## **Task: Diagramming relationships between system elements**
Identify relationships between elements, and hone in on understanding any key feedback loops operating in your system.
Begin to reorganize your system elements/variables to be able to better depict relationships and behaviors (usually depicted with arrows or process diagrams between elements).

You may be able to organize your map as so:
    - At the center of your system are interactions between elements (which could include __Roles __(discrete elements)__ __and__ Relationships __(lines connecting elements)
    - Those interactions depend on certain inputs or __Resources__ that produce certain outcomes or results -- these can be depicted by arrows
    - __Results __show up in the form of feedback loops and/or stocks and flows that indicate processes resulting in particular outcomes/outputs, behaviors, or dynamics. Key results or a summation of the system behavior might show up clearly at the right-side of your map, depending on how it is organized.
    - __Rules__ might live at the edges of your system, with icons or text to emphasize how they constrain or shape the system’s behavior
    - Outer edge or beyond system boundaries: “environmental” influences or relevant external dynamics


###  **Questions**
      
- What is the target result around which the system is defined?

Are there trends (increasing, decreasing) or patterns in the target result over time?

How is the target result evaluated by system participants? Is it valued?

What other results (positive/negative) are notable about the system?

How adaptive, resilient, or self-sustainable does the system seem to be?
        - Roles
            - What roles are actors currently performing?

Are some actors performing multiple roles?

Are some roles being played by different types of actors, such as both government and the private sector?

Are donors or other third parties playing prominent roles?

How effectively are actors fulfilling the roles they have taken on?

Are there issues of legitimacy or appropriateness surrounding the choice of roles that particular actors might take on?

Are there any roles that seem absent? Why?
        - Relationships
            - What types of relationships exist between role-players (formal/informal, contractual/hierarchical/reciprocal)?

How strong are these relationships

How valued are these relationships?

Are they collaborative? Mutually beneficial? Conflictual? Predatory?

Does the strength of the relationship vary depending on the actors involved?

Are there relationships identified as missing, weak, unnecessary or illegitimate?
        - Rules
            - What rules affect the way the local system functions?

Are the relevant rules formal (laws) or informal (norms)?

Are relevant rules enforced? How well? Effectively? Equitably?

Are actors in the local system able to modify the rules that affect them?
        - Resources
            - What resources are currently being used by the system in producing the target result?

Are there needed resource inflows that are missing or insufficient?

Are there trends (increasing, decreasing) or patterns (cyclical) in resource inflows?

What are the sources of those resources? Are they reliable and secure?

How well are the results that the system is producing being translated, through feedback loops, into sustained resource inflows?
