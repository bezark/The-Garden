[[Habits]]
- Make it Obvious
    - Fill out a Habits Scorecard. Write down current habits to become aware of them.
    - Use an implementation intention: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]
    - Use Habit Stacking: After I [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]
    - Design your environment. Make the cues of good habits obvious and visible
- Make it Attractive
    - Use temptation bundling. Pair and action you __want__ to do with an action you __need__ to do.
    - Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior
    - Create a motivation ritual. Do something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.
