# Reflecting on Progress So Far
## [[Build a Town]]
- So what I think I want to make is a group based communal rpg
- Perhaps you'r just working to grow your town and the world changes around you again referencing the [[Train Game]] here but yeah I liked this idea of being in a group together collaboratively building a little town and watching it change over time
- perhaps it starts at the incorporation of a town. You start by writing the town charter

![[Game 29 Brainstorm#^70a334]]
![[Game 29 Brainstorm#^7246e0]]

I liked the simplicity of [[Build a Town]]. I liked that buildings expanded actions:
![[Build a Town#Build]]

I want different buildings though.
Didn't like the random [[Build a Town#Forage]] though

## [[Race to Build a Town]]
![[Game 30 Brainstorm#Different buildings should be]]
![[Game 30 Brainstorm#Different natural features could be]]

another is to make story events
make more seasonal things- a winter deck
a deck for all seasons
a deck for the years
new events happen every couple of years

inter town trading- a market of bartering
returning to the actual train game- there could be different towns with different specialities.
There were really a lot of differen buildings in that- it would be worth it to return to those systems

(Look into the history of small towns)

Flour mill was very valuable- perhaps over powered

In general- I liked how difficult it was to earn food in the first version and I liked that you only ate at the end of the year- liked that it gave you time to prepare.
## [[On the Map]]
once you build town hall you unlock different buildings
You gain the ability to dig for resources

In general this game seemed juicy in some ways, broken in others and perhaps a little bit too much to do on one turn?
## [[Six by Six Township]]
Found this game very exciting. But there were certainly some holes in it.
