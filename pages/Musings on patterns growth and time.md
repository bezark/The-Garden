# Musings on patterns growth and time
Little shifts in [[patterns]] over [[time]] result in accumulations of large scale change.They amplify over time. [[Sol De Witt]] knew this. [[Trees]] know this-their bark growing outwards in expanding echoes of themselves. Ring after ring of repetition. Of a shape reborn. To try again. 

I think it's easy when encountering [[wicked problems]] or [[Hyperobjects]] to want to try and implement action movie style one hit wonder perfect solutions. To come up with some Grand gesture that will allow us to totally fix the thing then and there. I think this desire comes many places in our culture: obviously [[American Exceptionalism]] and [[The Hero's Journey]] And [[Descartes]] ([[Future Knowledges and the Dilemmas of Decolonization#^testy]]) along with so many more. ^zwn0k5g


But that's not how these things work. All we can do is implement slow and subtle changes that ripple outward in time. All we can do is change our behavior and ensure our behavior Stays changed. Yes there are [[thresholds]] but These are rarely intentional actions, moreso the emergent behavior of many agents changing at once. 
[[Emergent Strategy]] knows this. These outcomes, any outcomes really, are outside of any one person's control. They are in [[Box Two]] at the very least. Perhaps all one person can do is just focus on one little thing to do each day. [[Atomic Habits]] Was all about this. Just teach the children. Just awake up and try again tomorrow.

# Alternative clocks
Time as a circle. As a series of concentric circles. Orbiting around each other. All rotating at different speeds without any numbers. 

A clock that gets reset every generation
