[Gif and image written into the DNA of bacteria - BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-40585299)
      - **An image and short film has been encoded in DNA, using the units of inheritance as a medium for storing information.**
      - Using a genome editing tool known as Crispr, US scientists inserted a gif - five frames of a horse galloping - into the DNA of bacteria.
      - Then the team sequenced the bacterial DNA to retrieve the gif and the image, verifying that the microbes had indeed incorporated the data as intended
      - an image of a human hand and five frames of the horse Annie G captured in the late 19th Century by the British photography pioneer Eadweard Muybridge.
      - The researchers then employed the Crispr platform, in which two proteins are used to insert genetic code into the DNA of target cells - in this case, those of E.coli bacteria.
      - For the gif, sequences were delivered frame-by-frame over five days to the bacterial cells.
      - The data were spread across the genomes of multiple bacteria, rather than just one,
      - The information is not contained in a single cell, so each individual cell may only see certain bits or pieces of the movie. So what we had to do was reconstruct the whole movie from the different pieces

      - "Maybe a single cell saw a few pixels from frame one and a few pixels from frame four... so we had to look at the relation of all those pieces of information in the genomes of these living cells and say: can we reconstruct the entire movie over time?"
      - 90% accuracy
      - molecular recorders".
      - "encode information about what's going on in the cell and what's going on in the cell environment by writing that information into their own genome".
      - The timing component is important because it would be useful to track changes in a cell and its environment over time
