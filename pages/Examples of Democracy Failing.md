### The United States ^lgrv6in
The collapse of Democracy in the US is interesting because it is a very gradual creep here. I would actually posit that the Media has been largely responsible for the collapse in the system. Namely, there was a time when mainstream media outlets were few in number and more uniform in messaging. With the deregulation of these platforms along with the emergence of bottom up media ([[The Internet]]) 
- [[Traditional Hierarchal Media is not necessarily Better than Emergent Sources]]
- [[The Dangers of Emergent Media]]

Also the absolute gutting of the Republican Party.
