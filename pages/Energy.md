Energy is [[Force]] exert
ed over Distance.

[[Force]] x [[Length]]

 $E = ML^2/T^2$

But also [[E=mc^2]]

The  Unit of energy is the [[Joule]] and 

1 [[Joule]] = 1 [[Newton]] [[Force]] X 1 Meter Distance

"By far the most common definition of energy is 'the capacity for doing work'" but this only becomes clear "when you go beyond thinking about work as mechanical exertion...and apply the term in a generic manner to any process that produces a change"^[Smil, Vaclav. Energy: A Beginner's Guide (Beginner's Guides) (p. 16). Oneworld Publications. Kindle Edition. ]

There are, however, many different [[Types of Energy]] "on space and time scales ranging from galactic to sub-atomic and from evolutionary to ephemeral."^[Smil, 17]
