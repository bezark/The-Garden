- How can it be accessible to people with:
	- mobility constraints
	- audio impairments
	- visual imparments
	- A variety of devices

Thoughts:
- Make a 2D version
- make an auio only version
- remove video chat
- Make it text based/screen readable
- Make it easily controlled by different devices for mobility
- BUT keep it located in space. No matter what everyone is always in the same space TOGETHER
