[[Technology]] Shapes the way I think.
[[writing]] and [[PKM]] platforms are [[interactive systems]].

In [[Roam]] it felt frequently like I would loose track of things or I would let things go. I also found, however, that the system enabled me to write freely and without fear of constraint.

Here, in [[Obsidian]] I find that I am frequently trying to reformat things or rearrange my thinking.
Or rather I think I spend a lot of energy worrying about where to put things?
If things are named correctly? But at the same time, I feel like this is actually a place that I want to return to. A landscape I enjoy navigating.
