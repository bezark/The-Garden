Musings on the emergence of my cat toy
- An interesting example of [[emergence]] is my current cat toy. It's just a toy bird at the end of a long string. I've been perfecting this toy for several years now. The structure of the toy is the same: little fuzzy toy at the end of a long string. The details, however, change.
- The string, currently, is too long, and it's length produces interesting emergent effects: It gets tangled particularly at the end more. I have to use two hands to cast it. There is a threshold that it passes at some point and that causes these emergent moments of interaction
