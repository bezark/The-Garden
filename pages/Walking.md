	-   Don't exist
-   Repitition
-   Everything is Repetition
-   Days as Loops
	-   As feedback mechanisms
	-   As choices remade
-   Worn into earth
-   A path is a groove is a cycle is a habit
-   A Day is a revolution of the earth
	-   It is a turn
-   A tree is a repetition of a pattern at scale
	-   it is amplification
		-   amplification is repetition at scale
			-   scale is repitition in sequence
-   A flow is a movement through time
	-   A flow is route through time
-   Can we live in a way that is in scale with nature?
-   The earth is a shifting network of biological and geological structures
	-   It is a tapestry, a net.
-   A forest is a blanket of trees
	-   A blanket is strands of fabric and thread interwoven
		-   All structures are other structures and a ROUTE is a PATH is a pattern is a sequence of moving from one to the other to the next
			-   And a habit is already trodden ground
				-   is an unthought choice
