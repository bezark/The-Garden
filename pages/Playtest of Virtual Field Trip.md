Things I learned:
- The Teacher UI needs adjustments:
	- You want to be able to click and hop from student to student
	- You want to have a large face  appear when you click on a student
	- You want to know if someone is frozen or not frozen
	- You want the other buttons to DO things lol
	- Everyone is pretty small
	- Being able to zoom out was nice but It should be easier to zoom back in.
	- It Should be easier to zoom in general...
	-
