I guess [[markdown]] has always had promise to me because it's [[WYSIWYG]] for the [[Web]]. It's ostensibely a really straightforward way to format information and writing and ostensibly it's really viable. Or very easily readible by just about anything. I'm really kean to get it displayed on a device. I would be keen to get [[p5.js]] displayed on anydevice. Or rather running off of an [[Espruino]].

# Netlify Markdown Obsidian Site For Game Club
- make a game club miro hosted on a node server that has a markdown website
	- basically miro determines who plays what.
	- you also enter in what games you have and your phone number and you get a text about what game to bring. It also calculates how many your're willing to bring. Number of games that can fit in your back pack.
	  Like basically this:
	  <iframe width="768" height="432" src="https://miro.com/app/live-embed/o9J_lLhXBaw=/?moveToViewport=-288,-189,1152,612" frameBorder="0" scrolling="no" allowFullScreen></iframe>
	  
	  Use Miro API

	  	As someone who goes in a millrion directions
