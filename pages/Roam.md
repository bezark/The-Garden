A platform I used for [[writing]] and [[PKM]].

The legendary land of [[backlinks]] and [[multiplayer shared knowledge]]

Also had a very sketchy development path, a community that was predominantly white male productivity and tech bros, was on slack and cost $15 bucks a month...

called itself\#RoamCult for a while and was run by a twitter crazed nut job [[Connor White Sullivan]] who is either an asshole, a genius, both or neither...
