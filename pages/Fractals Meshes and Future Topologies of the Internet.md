# The Internet is Fractal

In [[Understanding Networks]] I'm captivated by the way [[The Internet]] appears to actually be [[fractal]] - it's [[routers]] all the way down etc. That's a dynamic Network obviously, but I guess that wasn't actually obvious to me. I think of the internet as a flattened experience because it's locked behind a screen two dimensional in nature. But it absolutely has depth and movement. Flow. I was [[Flattening Complexity]]

The question of how do you make self-monitoring self-regulating decentralized [[Mesh Networks]] is really interesting - perhaps if there were hardware in the routers themselves that automatically course corrected and throttled. Or perhaps you could [[encrypt]] the information and use of sort of [[Blockchain]]? LOL I was guess I'm just throwing words around, seeing what sticks.

But again it's the shape that's of it all  that's captivating - devices to routers -to other routers to [[Autonomous Systems]] to [[meet me rooms]] to [[Transatlantic Cable]] to meet me rooms to autonomous systems to routers to devices. Similar to branches on a [[tree]] or a [[file system]]. 

# Are Mesh Networks Truly Mesh Networks?
[[Mesh Networks]] I suppose would entail more direct device to device communication. Many more paths but each path a little smaller? The question is how quickly and how accurately can those paths be updated with mesh networks? Are they in real time? What factors determine an adjustment in a routing table in a mesh Network? Do routers and mesh networks move around? Like in space? Is a device in a mesh Network also a router or are they also ultimately end points? I know that with the particle mesh networks that I built for [[Zoltan's Zarkade]] each Xenon device was an endpoint and a node, so it's definitely possible. But if I were to get my internet through a mesh Network would it be possible for my cell phone to also be a router or a node? Or would it still be a endpoint ultimately? The idea that your phone would be a node and network is obviously unsettling - least of all because it would be a drain on your battery I imagine. But also perhaps not since your phone is apparently [[Networks of New York#^881343|already screaming all the time]]. Perhaps it can just be adjusted to scream other people's messages? But there's an ethical question in our individualistic society where we presume that our devices are our own. That other people don't have any input into what goes in and out of our device except for, hilariously, literally every app, service, message and missive that enters our device at any waking moment. For some reason that's fine with us, but the idea that somebody else's internet traffic would pass through our phone intentionally feels like it would be unsettling.

# The Future
## Imagining Devices Differently

There's something bigger here - what if personal devices were less personal? What if we returned to the old [[Unix]] philosophy of a device that was meant to be shared by many where, devices were a thing that brought a community of people together. What if your personal device could be converted into a community device? That's definitely already true with things like [[discord]] where your device is used to build a community, but that community still exists on somebody else's server and is dependent on the machinations of [[capitalism]]. 

## Grasping at Future Shapes...

Maybe I'm sounding a bit like a Doomsday prepper, but I don't think it's unrealistic to think about a future where we don't have reliable access to the big corporate servers at all times? Maybe that's a good thing to actually research for my [[Future of New Media Research Paper]] - the stability of our internet infrastructure. Because it is a question I've been wondering about a lot -will our internet infrastructure withstand the real damage brought about by climate change? Perhaps this is tied to edge computing whatever that is. I assume that it's something to do with taking the data out of data centers or servers or whatever and spreading them out in space more. Making less of a thick hierarchy and more of a true mesh network? Perhaps it also means bringing CPUs to toasters in a way that means they don't have to ask Central servers how long to toast your toast for. Which I guess is similar.

There's a thread here about the emergence of truly self-sufficient digital ecosystems - independent from Big tech and colonialism via internet infrastructure, what is the emergence of new ways of communicating coordinating and enacting life that avoids these systems of power? What are the trends in that direction? And in the other direction. In short, what does the future [[topology]] of [[The Internet]] look like and who will that give power to?
