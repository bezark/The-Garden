There are all these [[Systems]] in place. These historical accumulations. These mountains of expectations and assumptions about the way things need to continue to function over [[time]]. The [[Apocalypse]] assumes that they will all break down totally and suddenly- [[It is easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism]]. [[Legacy Life Among the Ruins]] on the other hand invites players to actively work to imagine a different alternative- a world that continues after a breakdown of a whole system, but not at any sort of end point.

![[Fearing the End of the World]] but that comes from a misplaced assumption that the current system we inhabit is the entirety of the world. It isn't- it's merely the dominant political-economic system that we exist in.
