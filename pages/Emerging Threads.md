- There are many things in this Roam That I want to hold onto. Here's a shortlist of what I want to hold in my Minds Eye:
    - [[Thoughts at the end of Fall 2020]]
        - "More importantly, I didn't let the perfect eclipse the good. I think I'm really proud of of the way I managed my stress and kept things in perspective. I focused on tangible goals and really used the lens of iteration and MVP. It turns out that just doing that several times in a row produces results that far surpass MVPness!!!"
        - I want to actually come back and answer these: 
            - "Reflection"
                - "What project was I most proud of over the course of the semester?"
                - "What project was the most difficult?"
                - "What big ideas did I encounter this semester that I want to hold onto?"
                - "What parts really worked well for me remotely?"
                - "What did not work well for me remotely?"

                - "What was my high point?"
                - "What skills did I develop?"
                - "What areas do I want to circle back to?"
            - "Projection"
                - "Make a list of at least 10 people I really want to work with next semester"
