## Thoughts on Decentralized Networks
After really big day, there are really thoughts about the [[Future of New Media Research Paper]] and [[Wikipedia]], [[Decentralized Networks]], [[Blockchain]], [[Trustless Systems]] systems and [[Proportional  Payment]]: What if there was a system where [[Networks]] formed around causes- like [[Co-Ops]] and used a distributed ledger system to verify truth. This would result potentially in [[A Future where Filter Bubbles are Entrenched]] but not it you could then build [[trust]] between networks- what if distance from values was equated to distance in the graph. What if there was distributed and proportional trust. with perhaps something like [[Proof of Stake]] but for truth. And agreement. 

**[[Proof of Trust]]**
