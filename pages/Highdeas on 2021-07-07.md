Read perhaps the most fearsome news I have in a while now.

That maybe this past [[Heatwave]] was perhaps not an exceedingly rare event now. That perhaps we have in fact passed some sort of [[threshold]] and that now this weather will be far more common.

Perhaps it is in fact another iteration of the [[logistic map]] and an instance of [[Chaos]]. Perhaps there is now some sort of sequence of events that has been activated.

I think it's imporant to talk about this stuff. To be candid right now about the very real potential for [[rapid systemic collapse]]

In the light of all that then the question is what am I doing about it? How can I help?

I don't exactly know. I don't want to have to know.

I guess in truth- do I?


[[Benny]] mentioned listening to that podcast- which I still want to listen to. They said that it was good at helping reframe the question- it's not "what must we all do right now", because that's more than any one person can hold. More so it's, "what is the next great action that I can take?"

What can I do in my life?

That has always been the question, but it's very hard to keep sight of.
