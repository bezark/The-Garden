### Idea
#review/games  #game/idea #itp/thesis 
Just read this in [[Basin and Range]]:
> People who admired Hutton’s theory of the earth became known—because of the theory’s igneous aspects, its molten basalts and intruding granites—as vulcanists or plutonists, and they quickly grew to be the intellectual enemies of the Wernerian neptunists, and others who believed that God had made the world through a series of catastrophes, notably the Noachian flood. The schism between these two groups would carry well into the nineteenth and even into the twentieth century, the ratio gradually reversing.

A [[megagame]] about a gradual scientific revolution. Where a new understanding of the world emerges. Where the scientific method is our into practice but the outcome is not certain. 

What if there is a sacred text/rules that explains how the world works but it is inaccurate
>“According to the conclusions of Dr. Hutton, and of many other geologists, our continents are of indefinite antiquity, they have been peopled we know not how, and mankind are wholly unacquainted with their origin,” wrote the Calvinist geologist Jean André Deluc in 1809. “According to my conclusions, drawn from the same source, that of facts, our continents are of such small antiquity, that the memory of the revolution which gave them birth must still be preserved among men; and thus we are led to seek in the book of Genesis the record of the history of the human race from its origin. Can any object of importance superior to this be found throughout the circle of natural science?”

What if there is a world to be uncovered or a truth that lies hidden and is not obvious. I guess sort of like the game in the Three Body Problem
