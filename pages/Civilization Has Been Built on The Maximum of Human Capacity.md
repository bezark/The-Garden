Each Human Being has a maximum amount of energy they can use at any given point in time. This is more than trivial though- many civilizations have been constructed on exploiting certain humans and asking them to perform labor at or near this capacity:

This thought on the work of Coal Bearers
>The mother … descends the pit with her older daughters, when each, having a basket of suitable form, lays it down, and into it the large coals are rolled; and such is the weight carried, that it frequently takes two men to lift the burden upon their backs … The mother sets out first, carrying a lighted candle in her teeth; the girls follow … with weary steps and slow, ascend the stairs, halting occasionally to draw breath. … It is no uncommon thing to see them, when ascending the pit, weeping most bitterly, from the excessive severity of labor. … The execution of work performed … in this way is beyond conception. … The weight of coals thus brought to the pit top by a woman in a day, amounts to 4080 pounds … and there have been frequent instances of two tons being carried. Assuming a body weight of 60 kg, a daily lifting of 1.5 t of coal from a depth of about 35 m would alone need about 1 MJ, and including the cost of carrying the coal horizontally, or on a slight incline—belowground to the pit’s bottom and aboveground to the distribution point—and the cost of return trips would bring the daily total to about 1.8 MJ. Assuming a labor efficiency of 15%, an adult female bearer would expend about 12 MJ of energy, averaging about 330 W during a ten-hour day. Modern measurements of energy expenditures in heavy labor confirmed that work at the rate of 350 W is sustainable during an eight-hour shift, but only rarely can it be exceeded (Smil 2008a). Clearly, the bearers were operating, day after day, many for years—they entered this work when seven years old, and frequently continued till they were upward of 50—**near the maximum of human capacity**.[^1]


also a perfect illustration of a fundamental fact of energetics, an impressive example of how every transition to a new form of energy supply has to be powered by the intensive deployment of existing energies and prime movers: the transition from wood to coal had to be energized by human muscles, coal combustion powered the development of oil, and, as I stress in the last chapter, today’s solar photovoltaic cells and wind turbines are embodiments of fossil energies required to smelt the requisite metals, synthesize the needed plastics, and process other materials requiring high energy inputs.

>The Greeks of the classical era often referred to their slaves in terms clearly placing them on the level of working animals (calling them andrapoda, man-footed, as opposed to cattle, tetrapoda)—but they gave us the fundamental ideas of individual freedom and democracy.[^2]

>The United States adopted its visionary constitution (“all men are created equal”) while the society was energized primarily by wood and while its principal drafter and the country’s fourth president, James Madison (1751–1836), was a slave owner, as were the first and the third presidents, George Washington (1732–1799) and Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826).

>Macroparasitism has assumed a variety of social controls of energy flows relying both on coercion—ranging from slavery and corvée labor to military conquest—and on complex (and partly voluntary) relationships among unequal groups of people. Special interest groups have become certainly the most important macroparasites in modern affluent countries. They range from various professional associations and labor unions with restricted entries to oligopolistic industrial cartels and lobbies. By shaping, and often vetoing or disabling, government policies and fixing prices, these groups work against the optimized use of all resources, and inevitably they have a notable effect on the development of energy resources and on the efficiency of their use. They have been behind the heavy subsidies that for decades have gone to producers of various fossil fuels and nuclear electricity, and now they are behind the new subsidies promoting the construction of solar photovoltaics and wind turbines (see box 7.3).
