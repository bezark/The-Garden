A way of looking at [[Time]] through the lens of long and slow change?

# [What Exactly is "Deep Time"?](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-deep-time-1440836)

> The Hindu series of yugas, for example, employs lengths of time so great as to be meaningless in human terms. In this way, it suggests eternity through the awe of large numbers.

> even geologists can’t really grasp geologic time. Instead, they have cultivated a sense of the deep present, a peculiar detachment in which it is possible for the effects of once-in-a-thousand-year events to be seen in today’s landscape and for the prospect of rare and long-forgotten events to occur today.

> Bishop James Ussher, of Trinity College in Dublin, made the definitive version of this chronology in 1650 and announced that the universe was created starting in the evening of 22 October in 4004 BCE.

> The term “[[Deep Time]]” was one of [[John McPhee’]]s most powerful phrases in a very good book, [[Resources/Readwise/Books/Basin and Range]], first published in 1981. It first came up on page 29: “Numbers do not seem to work well with regard to deep time. Any number above a couple of thousand years—fifty thousand, fifty million—will with nearly equal effect awe the imagination to the point of paralysis.” Artists and teachers have made efforts to make the concept of a million years accessible to the imagination, but it’s hard to say that they induce enlightenment rather than McPhee’s paralysis.
