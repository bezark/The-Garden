Lands slide around.
Thinking of time having passed
being gone.
waiting for something
same old nothing being written.
He wrte the same old poem a thousand times but nnnnnever got it right.

The utensis change.
Too lazy to grab  a pen now.

Still wondering if this will ever get read.

Wondering yet again what the point of all this is?
Where actually is anything [[headed]]
