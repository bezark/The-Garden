I've been hearing the phrase 'a narrow path to â€” ' lately. As in, 'the infrastructure bill has a narrow path to confirmation'. The impulse there is to assume that because the path is narrow, or doesn't have a lot or 'room for error', it is therefore unlikely that it will happen.

This, however, is not the case. You can have an incredibly likely scenario that doesn't have many routes to success: if you flip a coin, the path to getting a heads is very narrow because there's only one real way that can happen, but the odds of getting a heads are very high.

I suppose you might consider each possible flip though a path and that could be what is being referred to as narrow, in which case the two ideas would be linked.

But I do think that there are times when there is not a lot of room for error, but the odds of errors are generally low.

This intersects interestingly with a point made in [[21 Lessons for the 21st Century  Yuval Noah Harari  Talks at Google]] about [[random]] and [[deterministic]] processes:
