### What if...
- You made a geo audio book
- One that played snippets of basin and range depending on where’s you we’re on the country
- What if google maps was 4D and you could go back in time
- Generative soundscapes 

## When all the Continents were different
- There was a time when the continents were all in different places. 
- Not only that, but the poles were all reversed. 
- We looked up at different stars and the sky was different
- Is there any way to orient the ancient earth in relationships to its ancient stars?
- Did north exist?
- The moment when we transition into territory
- The invention of maps
- The representation of space
- The moment of transition from abstraction to representation. 
- To model.
- There wasn’t always a model. There might not always be one.
