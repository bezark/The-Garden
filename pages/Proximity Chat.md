- Not sure if this is an actual thing, but apparently that's what it's called in Among Us when there is voice chat dependent on location. I find this method of connection really powerful because it is a very subtle [[Feedback Loop]] and [[self correcting]] mechanism- if you want to hear someone less, walk away. If you want to hear someone better- move closer. Want to have a sidebar? Walk towards the person you want and they'll get the hint
    - In [[YORB]] interesting things happen- almost like a black hole people condense and overlap on top of each other. Everyone winds up standing inside each other in the 'Head Space' and no one wants to leave. I find that eventually there get to be too many people in a head and I have to break out like some sort of fly or restless bird in a [[flock]]
