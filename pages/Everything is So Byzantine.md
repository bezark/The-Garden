## Everything is So Byzantine
There is an unfathomable degree of [[compl]].
I've been shuttled around through phone trees and anonymous chat bots. My identity is parceled out in member numbers and group ids
The number of someone I called an hour ago no longer exists
Is it because my Middle Name is different from my given name
or is it because someone is on lunch break
and why does my insurance need to believe that other medications have been tried and not worked first?

And why does my psychiatrist get a kick back from the pharmacy that is replacing humans with forms and a veneer of care

There is a deep structural lack of care in the [[healthcare]] system.

No one is out there.

How can these [[Systems]] function at this scale? How can it not all collapse?

[[Fuck Technology]]
