# Research
## Initial Question/Thoughts
On Day one of Thesis research I walked in with the following big thematic questions:
- How can we hold the past and the future in our brains better?
- Can we Feel in our Bodies how crazy it is to move through big paradigms?
- How can we get help the kids imagine futures beyond capitalism that aren’t apocalyptic?
- How can we help the kids prepare for futures that are outside our comprehension?

If I were to retroactively try to distill what I was wondering about into a key set of questions, I would ask: *Can I make a piece of art that helps young people understand the scale of deep time and historical transformations?*

That's what I walked in with thematically. Formally I also walked in with some clear intentions: I wanted to learn how to make a Big Game (ie a game with a large number of players). I came to ITP to learn how to synthesize game design, immersive theatre and installations and media technology, and I really wanted to actively put a lot of those things into practice. I have designed Escape Rooms and interactive installations, directed plays and made games, but I have never successfully combined all those things together.

In some ways too, I was viewing this my Thesis as an opportunity to attempt to return to a project I had been working on for several years before ITP, but was never able to fully realize: The Train Game

The Train Game was my previous attempt to make a theatrical mega-game that spanned 100 years of US History.  It was a project I developed in Philadelphia from 2017-2019 with the help of Daniel Park and other collaborators. The goal of the project was to make a game that spanned 100 years of US history from 1789-1889 and would encompass Manifest Destiny, Westward Expansion, the invention of the telegraph and the railroad and the The Civil War. This was HUGE is scope and became very difficult to work on in some key ways: Firstly, I was struggling with trying to model systems accurately- in designing the game I was trying to create a very technical system that many players interacted with, and I wanted to that system to feel accurate to specific economic and historical trends.

However, in order to make a playable game I needed to simplify the world to a very rough apprximation of it's systems and this came into conflict with also needing to do justice to the real complex historical narrrative that was Westward Expansion in 19th centruy America
It ballooned in size, scope and complexity and most importantly- voice. I wanted to talk about very complicated issues but couldn't find the right way. I knew that the story of all this was way more complicated than I could imagine and I realized that it was ultimately a story that I wasn't fit to tell. It needed a much larger pool of creative voices. I tried to bring in more voices and perspectives through workshops and collaborations, but ultimately I found it too big in scope.

In a lot of ways it's been kind of a white whale of a project for me, and I've been in it's shadow ever since.
So for my thesis I wanted to return to both themes and forms that I first found in this project, but hopefully with a different set of values. I would like to hold space for Imagination and speculation without getting lost in the weeds of simulation and accuracy. I want to be rooted in real historical stuff but not be beholden to it, both for my sake and for the player's sake.

## Research Process & Plan
### Framing My Questions
So I initially split my research up into several key prongs and questions: Content- where can I turn to for broad histories of civilization technology and progress that DON'T reinforce nasty toxic narratives? Educational Precedent- has stuff like this been done before in museums or class-rooms? Has it been effective? Are there constraints this project would have to adapt to in order to fit in a classroom or museum? Game Design Precedent- what other games exist that might be mechanically or thematically related that I can learn from in designing this? Technical- How do I even MAKE a game at this scale in the time that I have? Ethics and Process- how can I (a privileged white guy in NYC) develop this project in a way that includes many other voices and perspectives?
### Using my Network
After framing my questions, the first thing I decided to do was talk with folks who were smarter than I was who could point me in the right direction. I talked with my Thesis advisor Stefani Bardin and one of my professors Jeff Feddersen and when they BOTH suggested that I read this cool new book *The Dawn of Everything* I took them at their word and started combing through it. It's a very big book and I'm a very slow reader, but it has already been profoundly helpful in trying to understand world history better.

I also turned to experts whose work I found inspiring and relevant to my project: I met with Sarah Rothberg whos Investing in Futures felt very relevant to my work. She had many great leads and resources for me to investigate and I started researching them. Similarly, I knew Jenny Lim and Greg Treffy's work was hugely relevant to my project: their VOXPOP Roleplays were an excellent example of using mega-game structures to role-play historical events in classrooms, and the Senate Immersion Module was literally the project that made me decide to come to ITP (More in Thesis Precedents). I connected with Art Kleiner whose The Future of New Media class exposed me to the fundamental concepts of Futures thinking. At some of our class events I went on to network with professional futurists and will be having extended conversations with them over the winter break. I met with Margret Smith who taught me how to utilize the reserach resources at NYU and exposed me to several critically helpful databases and tools.
Here's what I've found and learned so far:

## Findings
I found out a lot about history and games!
### Content
#### Most of what I understand about world history and civilization is wrong!
I've always thought that the technology of the The Industrial Revolution transformed the world by 'unlocking' latent potential and hidden stores of energy. But a question has really started to bother me: is that true? The Steam Engine was invented not to replace human labor in coal mines, it was to pump water from coal mines. Why was water in the coal mines in the first place? Because we were already digging so deep so as to go beneath the water table:
> With the [Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution "Industrial Revolution"), the demand for more coal also demanded dewatering of ever-deeper mines. Water was put in buckets and removed using rope conveyors powered by horses on treadmills.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mine_dewatering#cite_note-6) [Thomas Savery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Savery "Thomas Savery") was the first to realize that a steam engine could be used to pump water out of mines, so he patented an early form of a steam engine.

The need was already there. It was already being met with extensive use of human capital. As Smil writes: 
> While their use eliminated many kinds of animate labor (water pumping from mines, numerous manufacturing tasks), absolute reliance on human labor and animal draft kept on increasing during the entire nineteenth century. These realities have led to a reexamination of a widely held understanding that almost equates the adoption of steam engines with the process that is generally but misleadingly known as the Industrial Revolution.[2]

In these instances, the invention of these technologies did not replace or ease human labor, they *intensified* it. Not only that, but these technologies would not have been invented were it not for the possibility of financial reward that would only have been able to be gained *because of* this intensification of human labor. These machines *required* human labor to be pushed to the maximum in order to make them profitable.

#### Alternative Currencies
There have also been many different conceptions of what a currency even is throughout history! Many of them are very different from what we are used to. In Wendat Society there was currency but it had a very different FUNCTION. Unlike in our present world where Money is essentially Energy, there was no way to "transform access to material resources into power". Wampum was used as political currency and a way of gaining social cache. Perhaps also of tracking karma in some sense, but it was not a currency that could in any way constrain individual liberty. This is antithetical to how we imagine currency today.
> some people were indeed considered wealthy. Wendat society was not ‘economically egalitarian’ in that sense. However, there was a difference between what we’d consider economic resources – like land, which was owned by families, worked by women, and whose products were largely disposed of by women’s collectives – and the kind of ‘wealth’ being referred to here, such as wampum (a word applied to strings and belts of beads, manufactured from the shells of Long Island’s quahog clam) or other treasures, which largely existed for political purposes. Wealthy Wendat men hoarded such precious things largely to be able to give them away on dramatic occasions like these. **Neither in the case of land and agricultural products, nor that of wampum and similar valuables, was there any way to transform access to material resources into power – at least, not the kind of power that might allow one to make others work for you, or compel them to do anything they did not wish to do.** ([Location 911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08R2KL3VY&location=911))

#### The Industrial  Revolution radically transformed the entire world in ways that are very difficult to exaggerate.
It's also difficult to conceptualize just how grand the transformation actually was. Vaclav Smil does a decent job of trying to put numbers to it:
> It's hard to Overstate how radically the industrial revolution changed the world
When in 1900 a Great Plains farmer held the reins of six large horses while plowing his wheat field, he controlled—with considerable physical exertion, perched on a steel seat, and often enveloped in dust—no more than 5 kW...
A century later his great-grandson, sitting high above the ground in the air-conditioned comfort of his tractor cabin, controlled effortlessly more than 250 kW of diesel engine power. ...
In 1900 an engineer operating a coal-fired locomotive pulling a transcontinental train at close to 100 km/h commanded about 1 MW of steam power, the maximum performance permitted by manual stoking of coal...
By the year 2000, pilots of a Boeing 747 retracing the transcontinental route 11 km aloft could choose an auto-mode for a large part of the journey as four gas turbines developed up to about 120 MW and the plane flew at 900 km/h (Smil 2000a).

### Form
#### Megagames
*What are megagames?* As defined in Gaming the future a practitioner’s view: "Megagames are, by definition, games involving a large number of players. Typically, for a Megagame to yield useful results, we would expect in excess of 50 players. It is not uncommon for a megagame to involve a hundred players." Megagaming is new, but is growing, and is certainly being used educationally: "there is a growing international community of megagamers who are dedicated to bringing the pursuit into the classroom. They are writing, adapting and simplifying megagames so that pupils of all ages can enjoy them, too." ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1461234424/18053163)) Players usually have very specific roles and are almost univerally split up into groups or factions. Typically there is a lot of debate and negotion in megagames and most importantly: "Creativity and freedom are key. Players can choose to do almost anything within the game that is reasonable, which requires control players to decide if they can do things and if so, what the consequences are.

#### World Building Games
*What is a World building game?* A World building game is a Table Top Role Playing Game that is focused primarily on the action of collective world building or shared storytelling. Imagining a world together from a broad view rather than just running around as characters within it. Making a world building game is pretty key to the whole endeavor:
> World-building games help players envision other possible forms of social organization while demanding that they account for complexity and inequity. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409266086/16307124))
> Instead of centering heroic narratives, world-building games emphasize messy historical trajectories, everyday perspectives and the processes by which places begin, change and end. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409266086/16533541))
> World-building games challenge players to imagine radical alternatives for social and political organization. They represent a compelling way to rethink our own world: by inhabiting and thinking through a world in which things are different. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409266086/16307016))
> To effectively build worlds, players must be able to question their assumptions about our world, to consider other perspectives, to think about power, and to contend with the eventuality of their world’s end ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1409266086/16307119))
# Thesis
## Final Thesis Question

The future is in danger of being colonized by the powers of the present. We have a problem imagining the future, We also have trouble imagining the past. Games are great at simulating complexity, but they are frequently rooted in problematic assumptions (Board Games Inherently Reinforce Capitalism, Colonialism and Resource Extraction.) So many games rely on Tech Trees to simply model linear civilization progress, but the world is so much more complicated than that. The historical march of progress narrative we have inherited is deeply flawed, but there are real trends in technology and history. So How can we talk about scientific progress and civilization without reinforcing these tropes? 

In Basin and Range John McPhee posits that we might have a very bad time literally comprehending the scale of time beyond 5 generations:
> The human consciousness may have begun to leap and boil some sunny day in the Pleistocene, but the race by and large has retained the essence of its animal sense of time. People think in five generations—two ahead, two behind—with heavy concentration on the one in the middle. Possibly that is tragic, and possibly there is no choice. The human mind may not have evolved enough to be able to comprehend deep time. It may only be able to measure it. ([Location 1187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005J52SRE&location=1187))

While the notion of thinking in a Seven Generations timescale is becoming popular in sustainability, we are for the most part, still REALLY BAD at ACTUALLY thinking about what happened before us and ACTUALLY thinking about what will happen after us. This Project is born out of a real sense of wonder. Like, COSMIC wonder, at just the sheer weirdness of being alive in THIS place at THIS time. There have been SO many other constructions of the world.But our current world is unlike any of it's predecessors.The world we're inhabiting right now is SO NEW. Like dizzyingly new. Like osmotic shockingly new. It's hard to Overstate how radically the industrial revolution changed the world, but it's really important that we TRY to deeply comprehend that. It is really important that we all come to grips with the velocity of our world as quickly as possible. A velocity that has been accelerating over the past 250 years.

We are still IN MOTION. We are feeling the reverberations of choices made 250 years ago, their consequences are playing out now. They are moving people. They are changing landscapes. They are defining our futures. We need to FEEL the momentum of movement at glacial pace, and we need to KNOW that the pace of glaciers are accelerating.
Everything around us is brand new and fragile/flexible/evolving
Yuval Noah Harari said it well: he said that
Kids should be built like tents. They will need to reinvent themselves constantly. ([Time 0:03:54](https://annotate.tv/watch/614fe1b73fde1700080a0a34?annotationId=614fe1ba4827d500086d9853))

As said in The Dawn of Everything:
> If, as many are suggesting, our species’ future now hinges on our capacity to create something different (say, a system in which wealth cannot be freely transformed into power, or where some people are not told their needs are unimportant, or that their lives have no intrinsic worth), then what ultimately matters is whether we can rediscover the freedoms that make us human in the first place. ([Location 250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08R2KL3VY&location=250))

I guess what I'm ultimately asking if it's possible to rediscover these freedoms through storytelling and play? Through play we can simulate different ways of being. Together we can dream up better worlds and can imagine how to get there. The Future is not a neutral space. It is actively carved out- it is interpreted in the stars, the cards and the forecasts and trends and then it is steered towards. A Feedback Loop is perhaps a synonym for a self fulfilling prophecy... If we can't cultivate the skills to intentionally imagine radically different futures, then the future will be imagined for us.

## What is it? How will it work? Is there a target audience?

What if there was a card game that allowed you to create the entire arc of a civilization in a matter of minutes?
What if it was not just recreating the world as we know it, but it allowed and fostered a sense of imagination and curiosity about the shape the world could take?  What if there was a card game experience that really makes it FEEL like you're hurtling through time? That helps you imagine a different world than the one we're currently in.

Or what if it's a game that could be played by a whole audience, or say, a whole class either as a classroom exercise or as a part of a full-day field trip experience at a museum or artistic installation.Through playing it, an audience will practice systems thinking, feel the scale of deep time and historical changes and will dream up alternative power structures. Over the course of a single performance, an audience of players could tell the entire story of an imaginary civilization. They'll create forms of government and social structures, invent new technologies, lead social movements and radically change their imaginary worlds.

With the combination of trained performers, theatrical technology, game design, table top role playing and storytelling experience, I believe it's possible to create a theatrically compelling game experiences that can be played by a large groups of people all at once. I also believe it's possible to meaningfully simulate complex historical concepts to audiences in ways that are emotionally impactful and educational, imaginative and inspiring. 

This is obviously no small feat, and my very well prove way to broad in scope to actually be a meaningful experience. It it entirely possible that I will need to hone in on something far less broad than 'all of civilization', but at this juncture I really want aim for something that lets players fly through many different histories and possible futures in an imaginative and collaborative way that is also rooted in real historical trends and patterns. I want to imagine a civilization game that escapes the tropes of competition, hegemony and capitalism and encourages players to remember and imagine all the alternative ways of being that have existed or may exist yet. I want to explore generational change, the history of technology and 'progress' and ecological transformation and a bunch of other 'big things' in a light and speculative way.

I believe there is a way to thread this needle, but it will take a lot of trial and error. And I have to actively be very comfortable with not actually realizing this to it's fullest extent. It will require getting really precise about what actually matters at the core of the game play experience. And that will just have to reveal itself in due time...

## Draft Implementation Plan
### 1) Study Up *Winter Break*
Keep reading, The Dawn of Everything, Grand Transitions and The Systems Bible. I will also play several games including Civilization, [Epitaph](https://mkremins.itch.io/epitaph),Spore, Urban  planning department, Spirit Island and Oath.

### 2) Iterate on the Core  *Jan-March*
2022-01-17- 2022-02-25 Player Indigo Residency at The Cell

Output: 3-6 player 30 Min Game
I'll have a space and a budget for materials and collaborators
In January and February I will be in residency at *The Cell Theatre* where I will be charged with developing a 3-6 player 30 minute version of this game. This is incredibly helpful because most mega-games are fractal: they are a core game loop that gets repeated across multiple groups simultaneously. It is my hope that in 

### 3) Scale Up Game-play *March*
- Testing larger groups and systems
- I am taking Playful experiences which will really provide an excellent opportunity to work on the challenges of making games for larger audiences.
- I'll be conducting Larger Playtests
- Finding performers and designers

### 4) Technical Tests *April*
- Rehearsals and tests with technical elements
- Media Commons
- Public performance/playtests end of april
