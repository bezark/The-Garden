Starting to think about [[Resources/Readwise/Books/Emergent Strategy]] and how it connects to things like [[The Garden/Games]] and [[500 Years]] and teaching. It seems like we need a revolution in the way we teach kids. We need to emphasize community and collaboration as opposed to victory and individual success. Games should not have [[victory conditions]]. There is a question of how do you then orient player action around a shared goal. I'm thinking about all this as I watch a [[LARP]] camp and wondering about the persistent appeal of simulating [[combat]]. Why do we desire to fight? Why is that important to us as animals? There is obviously evolutionary suggestions but I wonder if those constrain our understanding of the actual systems we are embedded in-by saying we just evolved to be aggressive individuals in a[[survival of the fittest]] world we are really just preserving an old interpretation of the status quo. How can we reframe [[evolution]] ina way that embraces collectives?

What if classes all got one collective grade?
