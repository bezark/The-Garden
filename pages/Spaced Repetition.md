    - The basis for spaced repetition research was laid by [Hermann Ebbinghaus](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Ebbinghaus), who suggested that information loss over time follows a [Forgetting curve](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve), but that forgetting could be reset with repetition based on active recall.
    - Spaced repetition is a method where the subject is asked to remember a certain fact with the time intervals increasing each time the fact is presented or said. If the subject is able to recall the information correctly the time is doubled to further help them keep the information fresh in their mind to recall in the future. With this method the patient is able to place the information in their long-term memory. If they are unable to remember the information they go back to the previous step and continue to practice to help make the technique lasting. (Vance & Farr, 2007)
    - The expansion is done to ensure a high success level of recalling the information on the first time and increasing the time interval to make the information long lasting to help keep the information always accessible in their mind.
    - Spaced repetition is typically studied through the use of memorizing facts. Traditionally speaking, it has not been applied to fields that required some manipulation or thought beyond simple factual/[semantic](/wiki/Semantics "Semantics") information
