    - What is stability?
    - In a different context, the complex structure of the human heart is thought to confer robustness to perturbations at a wide range of scales by beating to a rhythm that is neither chaotic nor periodic but has a [fractal](https://www.pnas.org/content/99/suppl_1/2466) structure.
    - "[[Hypochondria]] is inherently a fear of a possible [[Future]]."
    - Perhaps too, temperature changes over time would be similar

Mammals get about a billion heart beats in a life time
