>You can call it the metaverse, the mirror world, the AR Cloud, the Magicverse, the Spatial internet, or Live Maps, but one thing is for certain, it’s coming and it’s a big deal.


>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse") defines it as a collective virtual shared space, created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual space, including the sum of all [virtual worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_world "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_world"), [augmented reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality"), and the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"). The word "metaverse" is a [portmanteau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau") of the prefix "[meta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta")" (meaning beyond) and "[universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe")"; the term is typically used to describe the concept of a future iteration of the internet, made up of persistent, shared, 3D virtual spaces linked into a perceived virtual universe.

[[Reactions to Mirrorworld]]


My first encounter with the [[Metaverse]] was when I tried the [[Hololens]] for the first time. While the technology was clunky- when I hooked it up to the wifi, I was able to have the network login info on the ground next to the router. That dialogue lived down there right where the password was written in physical space. This was profound.
