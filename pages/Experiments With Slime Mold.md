There are several experiments I would love to do with [[Slime Mold]]:
- Input with capacitive touch sensing?
- Measuring voltage
- binary pattern recognition.
- use A camera and [[Machine Learning]] image recognition in conjunction with an oatmeal feeding [[XY Plotter]] to communicate with them.

When working with slime mold I feel like it's important to remember :
- [[Notes on Plasmodial Improprieties]]
- Essentially treat it respectfully 
- Treat it like a collaborator
