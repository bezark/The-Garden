[[Life]] is a [[Self-organizing]] [[System]].

Life is a [[chemical reaction]] that transforms [[The Garden/Energy]] and creates complex structures that preserve more highly ordered configurations of matter.

[[Entropy]] takes these structures and scatters them over [[Time]]. Entropy un-structures. Entropy and Life are opposites.

- > "Despite its supposed universality, the second law appears to be constantly violated by living organisms, whose conception and growth (as individuals) and whose evolution (as species and ecosystems) produces distinctly more ordered, more complex forms of life. But there is really no conflict: the second law applies only to closed systems under thermodynamic equilibrium. The Earthâ€™s biosphere is an open system, which incessantly imports solar energy and uses its photosynthetic conversion to new plant mass as the foundation for greater order and organization (a reduction of entropy)."^[Smil, Vaclav.
