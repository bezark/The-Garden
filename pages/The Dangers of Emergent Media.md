There is fear that Bottom Up [[Emergent Media]] platforms more readily peddle falsehoods. This is true, and the falsehoods certainly pull people in many directions creating [[Filter Bubbles]] and [[Widespread Conspiracy Theories]]

Also, while it may seem like these platforms are more free than [[Traditional Media Institutions]] because they rely on user generated content, they are in fact not free from organizing principles. Those principles are just less directly perceivable to users. They are organized by raw mathematical algorithmic capitalism and maximize profits in ways that seem bizarre to most of us ([[Youtube Recommendation Algorithm]]), but have been proven to produce dangerous emergent effects such as the radicalization of the right wing
