    - # Unity Hotkeys
        - This page gives an overview of the default Unity Hotkeys. You can also download a PDF of the table for [Windows](https://docs.unity3d.com/560/Documentation/uploads/Main/Unity_HotKeys_Win.pdf) and [MacOSX](https://docs.unity3d.com/560/Documentation/uploads/Main/Unity_HotKeys_Mac.pdf). Where a command has **CTRL/CMD** as part of the keystroke, this indicates that the **Control** key should be used on Windows and the **Command** key on MacOSX.
        - The Mac trackpad also has a number of shortcuts for navigating the Scene view. See [Scene view navigation](https://docs.unity3d.com/560/Documentation/Manual/SceneViewNavigation.html) to learn more about these.
