Fundamentally, I have no control over [[Time]]. I cannot control when things will happen. I cannot control when people will be ready to do things and when I will be ready to do things, for I am [[Emergence]] not a [[Command and Control]] [[Systems|system]]. [[my body]] has needs that I really should listend to and [[my mind]] goes where it wants to. I can advocate for and imagine what I want to do in The [[Future]], but I cannot [[control]] it.

This is a key truth underpinning [[The Path]].
