We naturally think in [[linear]] ways. We imagine a thing that happens will happen at the same [[rate]]. Perhaps this fundamentally has to do with the predictability of [[a day]]. The stability of our orbit around the sun and the gradual nature of it's shape. [[Seasons]] change slowly (or at least traditionally have changed slowly.) This leads us to imagine that most [[rate of change]]s are linear too. We [[humans are bad at understanding exponential trends]].
