[Filter bubble - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble)

A **filter bubble** is a term coined by the Internet activist [Eli Pariser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wiki/Eli_Pariser "Eli Pariser") to refer to a state of intellectual isolation[\[1\]](#cite_note-twsTechnoP101-1) that can result from [personalized searches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wiki/Personalized_search "Personalized search") when a website [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") selectively guesses what information a user would like to see based on information about the user, such as location, past click-behavior and search history. As a result, users become separated from information that disagrees with their viewpoints, effectively isolating them in their own cultural or ideological bubbles.[\[5\]](#cite_note-5) The choices made by these algorithms are not transparent.[\[6\]](#cite_note-6) Prime examples include [Google Personalized Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wiki/Google_Personalized_Search "Google Personalized Search") results and [Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wiki/Facebook "Facebook")'s [personalized news-stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wiki/News_Feed "News Feed"). The bubble effect may have negative implications for civic [discourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wiki/Discourse "Discourse"), according to Pariser, but contrasting views regard the effect as minimal[\[7\]](#cite_note-twsO13-7) and addressable.[\[8\]](#cite_note-8) The results of the [U.S. presidential election in 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wiki/United_States_elections,_2016 "United States elections, 2016") have been associated with the influence of social media platforms such as [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wiki/Twitter "Twitter") and Facebook,[\[9\]](#cite_note-9)[\[10\]](#cite_note-:4-10) and as a result have called into question the effects of the "filter bubble" phenomenon on user exposure to [fake news](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wiki/Fake_news "Fake news") and [echo chambers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wiki/Echo_chamber_(media) "Echo chamber (media)"),[\[11\]](#cite_note-DiFranzo_&_Gloria-Garcia_2017-11) spurring new interest in the term,[\[12\]](#cite_note-twsGuardian421-12) with many concerned that the phenomenon may harm democracy and [well-being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wiki/Well-being "Well-being") by making the effects of misinformation worse.[\[13\]](#cite_note-twsWired989-13)[\[14\]](#cite_note-twsNYMag4923-14)[\[12\]](#cite_note-twsGuardian421-12)[\[15\]](#cite_note-:6-15)[\[16\]](#cite_note-:8-16)[\[17\]](#cite_note-:9-17
  >(Technology such as social media) “lets you go off with like-minded people, so you're not mixing and sharing and understanding other points of view ... It's super important. It's turned out to be more of a problem than I, or many others, would have expected.”
