Night is falling. And I'm thinking about home.
The rain stings on the plexi, the stars obscured by clouds. The stars would be orange, the clouds would be green. 
I haven't been home in a while now.
I remember helping my mom move. I remember she tried to help. I remember I tried to help. I lifted a couple of boxes before it was too hot. The movers had one of those lifters though. They were alright. I think.
We planned to do it in February. There were a lot less houses than I remembered. A lot of ash and heat. Not trying to be dramatic, there was just a lot of ash and heat.
I remember she couldn't get here stuff for 4 months because the truck drove itself to the dakotas. They even started unloading it. It was my fault I think- I didn't realize that the block had shrunk the window for voluntary destination selection to 2 weeks. In all the movement I guess they accelerated the time frame. That's one theory anyway- my conspiratorial brain thinks it was route skipped by one of those radical communes. I remember when we finally got all the furniture back the I thought couch sort of smelled different. Like somebody else's butt...

But I don't even know if those groups actually exist now. Or if they ever did. It's hard to know what to think. I used to fill my head with as many different feeds as possible- alternate perspectives, but as they moved further apart I actually just stopped understanding things. Like the vocabulary was too different and I kept getting confused about what was actually happening. Were we in a 'war' or was it unrest? Could I go home or couldn't I? Are we at the beginning or the end? ^c03e08

When they split the currencies and blocked the cross talk and it all got simpler.

Mom would never have liked it in the Dakotas.
Of course I'm at Dad's house all the time. He still lives in LA. And his 'house' is pretty accurate. He got all the gadgets and took the time to do a full scan. It's the best house I know. And he is pretty accurate. He was an apple convert from literally the 90s and they have basically all of his data. We've been to his house so much now that when I visit him I don't know if it's him or my memory of him. I don't know if he's in there or not. I don't know where his actual body is. Maybe in Omaha I think. Last I heard.
Am I in Omaha?
I look out the window- the road flashes by. Stripes whizzing out of blackness, visible for an instant, hurtling into blackness yet again. Barreling forward. Heading somewhere.

## Scratch
- There are different corners. Everyone in different sectors
- The NYPD in armed conflict over water supplies with nighboring totalities
- the feds as illusive and ineffective
- sports as
- autonomous systems let loose.
- micro polinators
- autonmous systems resulting in confusing but not terminator like choices.
	- miscalculated flight patterns
	- inexplicable 'snow storms' grounding air traffic control when no weather is present
	- data storms
- apple will hold an artifact of my dad which will talk like him and look like him and I may or may not be able to tell if it is him or if it isn't. Perhaps I will wonder if he is dead or alive.
	- He also might be alive
- I don't think he'll be in los angeles though. I don't know how los angeles will be in los angeles.
- There might be two americas sitting on top of each other with 2 different presidents (seems a little too current events...)
- A whole generation of migration. Of transience. Perhaps what is space with augmented reality? Maybe we'll all be living in camper vans and cyber trucks. Militarized mobility. Always on the move.
- Maybe we all live in hotels.
- Maybe Jeff Bezos buys the amazon rain forest
- With the wealth riots more billionaires than ever have migrated entirely to crypto and live as paupers in dusguise, roaming around like the rest of us. 
- No boody knows where the celebrities went.
- the 1% has vanished.
- Dependent on mobile food synthesizers?
- or MREs and fast food
	- On beyond burgers
	- We all live on pretty tasty synthesized food
- Different corps and states have partnered
- Different gov bubbles
