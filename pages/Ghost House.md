Project for the [[Bezark Company]]
[[Three.js ]] [[Obsidian]] based variantb of the [[DFM Project]]-  where ypu can create new rooms with obsidian like plain text srcripting and those create templates of digital rooms that people can enter. Essentially creating a really simple tool for gming virtual larping
can use simple ml models for parsing descriptions and interpreting language to then pull from 3d sites/environments to then creat those spaces.
The are [[Yorb-like]] experiences that can exist or collapse at will.

If i could make a video game by literally writing a story.
each page could have a different gltf model it could load in a codeblock
different performer video options or controls.

Example: the cantina/stage would make you appear on stage with performance controls or a game
Cantina/guest would take you to a cantina space where you could watch a performer on a stage or get a drink at a bar

Cantina/bar would take you to the bar where you had to be a bartender and make drinks for people
