This came up while high and looking at [[Projects on Deck]]
It's interesting to see the way these emerge.
How through writing and revising, the structure transforms and emerges.
Yes I am technically thinking about these different formal deadlines and constraints, but in reality they are just moments in [[time]]. My interests and passions are what should produce these efforts, and my curiosity guides them:

What am I interested in?
What should guide me?

Whatever I choose to focus on this semester is what I will do as "projects"

What even is a [[deadline]] other than a moment in time of evaluation? This connects to the [[Days as Bubbles]] idea 
also connects perhaps to [[Notes on Design Matters with Seth Godin]]
