Cold open 

to quickly genrealize the history of everything:
- we make networks and hierearchies
	- maybe just networks...
- Hieratchies suck
- the the good growth of everything is about taking power from the few and bringing it to the many
- about moving from hierarchies to networks

Networks vs. Hierarchies





Most note-taking platforms enforce hierarchies.
The File system is a hierarchy prizing nodes closer to the ROOT directory


When writing in a hierarchical paradigm most of your energy goes towards meeting the systems needs:
- However you structure your data you still spend your time thinking about where to place things.
- Also because things live in distinct places you tend to store them away and not look at them

- Also your Notion gives Jeff Bezos Money
- (Sorry I'm not sorry)

Benefits of Networked based notes
- Emergent Ideas!
- SpOnTanEoUs CoNnEcTiOnS
- Fun diagrams!

---
Options for Networked Notes:
- Roam
- Obsidian

---
Roam Sucks
- Entirely Browser based
- You don't own your data
	(and it sure as hell isn't secure)
- The development path is... questionable?
- The Community is dominated by gross Productivity-Bros
- it costs $15 a Month
- It's UGLY

OBSIDIAN

---
Obsidian
- IS FREE
- Is BEAUTIFUL
- Is entirely markdown based and uses local files which means it's
	- Future Proof
	- Private
