Looking for some sort way in to this process
prehaps the appraoach is to use the [[Generation Ship Game]] as an entry point
personal intimate chaotic vulnerable goofy

what if we're all parents
what if there is  a robo battle 
what if there is a dance off
a generational challeng of rearing the best robo
what if there 

eachj person needs to pass something  dow to their children
like a game of telephone of indeterminite length
bopuncing bvalls
sketching sketches
instructional movement
