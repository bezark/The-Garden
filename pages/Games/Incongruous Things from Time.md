I've been getting really into geology, history, futures speculation, colective imaging and divination recently, so I'm sort of thinking I want to play a game where we're all anthro-geological-mediums (or some other silly title) and we are investigating the features of this and mysteries of this rubble (and perhaps park). We'll really look at and talk about rocks and rubble, but the secret is that before hand I'll delicately scatter bits of technological debris from a variety of different points in time and other oddities throughout the rubble to sort of open us up a little bit.  Players will all comb through it and just sort of collectively speculate about where in time all these things came from. We'll ask questions about the past and future of this place and just sort of see what little mysteries emerge. The game can be done with any number of players for any duration of time and we can play it any number of times. As we get closer I'll try to hone in on some questions to ask people, maybe there could be written reflection on clipboards or something- not sure yet what that looks like.

Anywho that's what I'm excited about right now and I'd love your input. I'd also really benefit from seeing this majestic rubble in advance. Would you want to go for a visit sometime soon? Also it looks like Benny isn't gonna be able to make it, but I'd love to invite a friend or two if possible. No worries if that's difficult though.

Hope all is really groovy with you!





# Prompt

John—Great questions. I love the idea of a bespoke party game but considering the fact that I am crafting a puzzle for this, I personally won’t have much bandwidth to work with you on something. Always happy to bounce ideas back and forth tho.

Re: something 35 ppl can play at once, I love this idea but it should be rather passive/not required. E.g., a few years ago I gave 15 people each a handful of paint chips across a spectrum of gray scale (person A had 5 of the lightest, person B had 5 of the second lightest, etc.) and each one had an ice breaker question on it. When you answered a question you received a paint chip. As it got darker it became harder for people to tell which ones they had or needed, which was maybe annoying fun, but that was challenge was you could say ‘I need red’, you had to look closely at what other people had and try to compare shades. Eventually (pretty quickly) someone had all the different shades and they won.

SO if you wanted to do something like that, that’s cool and/or something that 4-6 ppl can play at a time outdoors, real quick-style (5-10 min?) that would be aces. Let me know if you would need a table for this, which I can source and set up. However if this is something that folks can squat on rubble and play (there is some rubble at our favorite new abandoned park) that would be weird and cool.

In terms of theme, we love things that are personal, intimate, chaotic, vulnerable, goofy.   

# Artifacts from an Incongruous Past
What if you are driving through rubble and piecing together a story about a time gone by. 
You could take an object and shatter and scatter it
You could date rocks to different time scales
You could field questions from amateur geologists.
