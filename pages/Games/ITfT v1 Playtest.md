This was a really wonderful experience. I learned a lot about running games and running this. I really enjoyed the weird things everyone came up with and I think folks did a reeally great job of using their imiganations.
I think it was a little less structured than I would have liked- there were times when it felt a little unclear how to engage, and I feel like the game would fall flat without my rigorous gming.

It also got a little confusing when I tried to bring in the future- it seemed hard to parse what belonged in the future and what belonged in the past. How do you build cohesion while allowing differences?
Are there ways I can encourage exploration and contradiction?
COuld we come up with a more formal psuedo scientific method to practice as a structure for turns?
Would more structure yield more fleshed out worlds?
Would prompts or phases help?

What would different age groups, sobriety levels, locations and artifacts yeild?

## Things to Try
- Letting someone else run it
- preparing more of a worksheet with actual questions, drawing spaces
- Focusing on JUST the future or JUST the past
- Having some analysis tools
