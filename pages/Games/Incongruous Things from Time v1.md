parentGame:: [[Incongruous Things from Time]]
#game/dev/iteration

# Setup
- Pick a time and place to gather
- Gather a bunch of strange objects that don't belong together at all
- Scatter them about the place. Hide them.
- Bring a surface, something to write with and write on and a lab coat.
- Don the labcoat and inhabit the role of a wandering anthro-paleo-microbial-geologist who is wandering wildly through space-time.
- Stare at the objects and scratch your head. Act confused and invite conversation

# Object of the Game
Get those you interact with to answer the following questions to the best of their ability:

- What is the history of this place and these objects?
- What is the future of this place and the objects?
- What should we do with them?

## More specifically you can ask
- Where/When did these objects come from?
- Where are they going?
- How were they used in the past?
- How will they be used in the future?
- Why are they HERE?
- What was this place in the past?
- What is this place in the future?

# Gameplay
## Introduction to history
- Invite people to appreciate the mystery of this place:
	- "Look around you! Isn't this place strange? What are all these people doing here? What are all these things doing here?"
	- "I have deep suspicions about this place. There are a lot mixed messages, crossed wires, things from different points in time all sort of strewn about"
- Ask them to find objects and bring them to a place
- Ask them to arrange them in tableaus. 
- Ask about their histories and sotries
- Encourage everything
	- "There are a multiplicity of histories to everything. Seek out the dialectical thought. Multiple things may be true at the same time"
- Ask to envision the overall history of this place
- **But let things stick out and not add up**

## The realization of the future
Realize slowly that perhaps some of these objects don't just come from the past, but may come from the future! 
> "Everything here has geological, anthropological and physical process actining upon it that pushed it into this moment in the present. Perhaps though, the reverse is true: perhaps there are future geological and anthropological and physical processes that are reaching back to the now and are pulling these objects into the future!"

Ask about the future of the objects.
What will they be used for? Who will use them? What will this place be in the future. Encourage debate, and contradiction

**But start gathering players to present their findings**

## The Balance
- Present findings
- Come to the conclusion that this space is periously balanced between many overlapping histories and many potential futures
- ask What do we do? With all the stuff? How do we best leave the space for the future that we want?
- Everyone put everything back exactly where you found it
- Seek consensus or not. But follow through and don't force an outcome
