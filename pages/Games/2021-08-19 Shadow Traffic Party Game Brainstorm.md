Game:: [[Incongruous Things from Time]]

Little rock island
Each person is the mayor of their own little rock island
They create a little UN
debate things
Try to piece together the shared history of their  rubble
Maybe they are making sculptures
Maybe each rock is a currency
Imagining an ancient past consists of telling one fact telephone style
But actually instead of building on each other it's supposed to deliberately contradict
Perhaps the rubble is from the future and we're conducting an analysis of the history of the future. 


Just say the stuff comes from another place in time

Culminates in them drawing a picture of this city
Then they take something and leave something else behind
Maybe they rip up their drawings
Maybe there are deliberately anachronistic props mixed in, old watches and future technology
Maybe we all have headlamps

Any Speculative claim must be backed up by observational evidence
