- Playtesting should not be part of design, it should be part of refinement or development. Playtesters should not be helping you design a game. If you’re doing this, you should rethink your methods.
- Playtesters are not precise. Their evaluation of an element in the game is from a limited view point. If they spend most of their efforts working towards one victory path, then they will devalue an element that works for a different victory path.
