After writing my [[Thoughts after 10 Games]], I have decided to implement a few changes in my process for the project [[ITP/100Days/Blog/Reflections/100 Days of Making Games]]. Firstly, I'm changing the title! Previously I was referring to this project as "50 Games in 100 Days", but I've realized a couple of key things about this:

- Nobody is counting! I am pretty sure that it is not ACTUALLY important that I have 50 countable games at the end of this process.
- What is more important is that I develop a sustainable practice for making games.
- Making a new game every 2 days is NOT SUSTAINABLE! For the past 25 days I have felt like I've been zig zagging all over the place, starting something new every other day and rushing to blurt it out and then starting over again. This hasn't been working.

So what I think I need in my process is a little bit more time for testing, reflecting and planning. I think my process for quickly developing games actually wants to take three days:

- I need one day to percolate and formulate ideas and iterate.
- I need a second day to iterate and articulate. 
- I need a third day to playtest with people who AREN'T ME, reflect on the game and begin to plan the next one.

So at least for the next week I'm going to try this three day process instead. I'll still be doing active work on the third day: conducting playtest is a skill I need to develop in and of itself, and I'll be doing active written reflections and projections. 

I also feel like I am zagging around a little too wildly from game to game, so I think at least for the next couple of days I'm going to make a rule that says I have to bring 1-2 things from the game I just made into the next game. This can be a mechanic or a themes or an idea. It can't be more than 2 things though, because I still want to make NEW games every couple of days.

I am starting with my [[ITP/100Days/Blog/TheGames/Sigil Story Playtest 2021-02-13]] and will continue from there. Here's to change!
