I have very recently entered the [[valley of Dissilusionment]] or the [[The Valley of Death]] or the Low point on the journey. 
Or at least, I was recently very frustrated in my process of making games.
With the last project, [[Find The Bridge]], I found myself really focusing on the product- I got hyper focused on wanting it to appear a certain way in the world.
I think a part of this is definitely due to the fact that it was a web game- this made it so that it was fairly difficult to execute if it was not 'polished' or 'functional' in some capacity.

At the same time, it was really hard for me to keep things in perspective. At [[ITP]] at large at the moment, I realize that I have allowed myself to fall into the trap of feeling very [[Product oriented]] instead of [[process oriented]]. I have been focusing on creating objects that feel complete and meet certain standards and expectations from the external world, most of which are entirely imagined by yours truly. I find that there has been a tendency within me to feel the need to do something that feels 'done'.  ^56bcc8

While my process with [[100 Days of Making Games]] requires a certain amount of 'done ness' (I still really believe that it's important for me to articulate playable experiences) I keep thinking things need to be good, or people need to like what I'm making or I need to have something that lives up to what I imagine. I must remember that I don't. ^9d50be

Also, this thread is emerging and gnawing at me. As I've written about before- [[Board Games Inherently Reinforce Capitialism, Colonialism and Rescource Extraction]] and that is, spoiler alert, STILL TRUE. It is interesting that when I play games, I yearn for a simulation of capitalism, or colonialism or violence. I yearn for an achievable victory condition and I appreciate games that have very complex systems of interaction that simulate these [[Oppressive Systems]]. I would like to really challenge myself going forward to find ways to explore complex mechanics and systems without perpetuating these ideologies. How can you have a game that is challenging, strategic and yet does not require a victor? How can you make interesting systems of transaction that don't need money per-se?  ^576844

These are all questions that I have been asking before, but I'm asking them again because they haven't gone anywhere. I want to hold them in my process.
I also want to focus again on PROCESS. On PRACTICE. On finding ways to let this space be exploratory. Be a safe space for me. Be a time of day that I LOOK FORWARD TO. That DEPENDS on cultivating the space. Cultivating the activity it self and NOT depending on the outcome. I would like to figure out how to find that.
