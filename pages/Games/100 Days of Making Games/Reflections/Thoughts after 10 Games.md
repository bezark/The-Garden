I am currently making [[ITP/100Days/Blog/Reflections/100 Days of Making Games]]. I have been pretty much plowing ahead with these games full sped, so I figured that this would be a pretty good juncture to reflect on some of the progress I've made so far and where I want to go next. Here are a series of questions I will answer every 10 games to try and track my progress and chart my course!

## How would you summarize the games you've made so far?
I guess I would summarize them as very text heavy and traditionally tabletoppey? That has partly been a symptom of the process: in ideally spending a total of 2 hours tops on each game, that doesn't leave me a lot of room for expanding beyond very simple paper prototypes. However, there still is a lot of room for experimentation that I am finding myself not really diving into yet: per my understanding of [[What is a Game]], all I really need to make each day is something with a finite duration that can be executed by a player or players on their own. That's pretty broad and would allow me to make things like:
- Sports
- Explorations of spaces
- Websites
- Videos or Podcasts
- So much more...
  
   So it's notable that I am finding myself sticking to traditional 'board games' in a lot of my thinking. This is certainly intentional: I am trying to focus on the basics of game design and I think is easily honed through board games. But there is also something interesting about how [[Board Games Inherently Reinforce Capitalism, Colonialism and Rescource Extraction]]. I am trying to not lean into this too much, but I am finding that when I make a game in 2 hours it is easiest to start with tropes that perhaps perpetuate systems of oppression- even simple mechanics like [[Points]], [[Territory Control]], [[Currencey]], [[Markets]], [[Trading]] all are [[Colonial]] in nature.
## What Games am I most proud of and why?
The Games that I am happiest with so far I think are [[A Flower for Spanky]], [[Magical Candy Factory]], [[Dice Bocce]] and maybe even [[Boot Fall]]?
For teh first two, I am really happy with the story telling in both of those games. I think [[Magical Candy Factory]] has some really interesting [[Mechanics]] and I think that [[A Flower for Spanky]] is really nicely emotional and a great use of the platform. Of all the games, I suspect [[A Flower for Spanky]] has been played by the most people simply because it is playable directly on social media.

What I like about [[Dice Bocce]] is the inventive use of dice. And I like [[Boot Fall]] because it I think is a somewhat decent representation of an actual sport.
## What Games am I least proud of and why?
Definitely felt pretty rushed with [[Hexapods]]- I'm not too sure if that's even a fully playable game. Similarly, the first game I made [[Don't Get Sick]] felt very rushed and overly complicated and thematically insensitive. 

In general, I think the games I hace struggled with the most have been the ones where the parameters weren't clear enough for myself. The games that I have made that I am the most proud of all had pretty clear constraints whereas the ones that feel like they were too rushed were too broad in scope. Going forward I think it's really important that I continue to give myself clear constraints in my prompts for each game.
## What has been working well in the process so far?
Something I've really liked about the process is sitting down to an empty desk and just playing with materials. Tokens, cards, dice. Sketching on paper. Allowing myself to be free form for a bit and letting mys self wander has been really helpful.
## What part of the process need adjusting?
- There are several facets that I think need revamping-
- Firstly, while I like making a game every two days, I still feel like I'm either taking too much time with a game or I'm taking too little time with it. I think really what it is is that because I am focusing on sharing a playable game every two days it feels like half the time is spent designing the game and the other half of my time is spent writing rules.
- That's all well and good (it is very important that to me that I continue to articulate fully playable games), but I don't think I need to continue to present them in written text, particularly since those don't convey well on instagram.
- Something else I want to clarify is my internal timeline- I would really like to end my first day of two day games with something that I can "play the next day". I guess I usually do this, but it continues to feel unclear what work I do on the first day vs what work I do on the second day.
- But the biggest thing I need to adjust is that I AM NOT PLAYTESTING ANY OF THESE GAMES.
- Part of that is certainly the pandemic, part of that is the design of my process but another big part of that is fear, and I think I need to overcome that fear. So I need to now bake playtesting into my process, and that has to start asap. From here on out I will dedicate one day a week to playtesting my games. I will compensate for that by designing more simple one-day games at the top of the week to make sure I have extra room in the schedule for playtests.
## What areas doe you feel like you've really explored?
I feel like scratched the surface on many things but haven't dug deep into anything yet. No area feels 'done'.
## What areas have you not explored?
Still want to really dig into:
- Games with MANY players
- Sports
- Card Games
- Experimental Biz
- More TTRPGS
- Internet Based games.
  
  There is still so much to do!
