- I type a lot. Like a whole lot.

I make the joke that really it's been 100 Days of Writing Rules.
Which is true. I've certainly written a lot of rules. As of 2021-04-21 (day 92) I have written fully playable instructions for 36 games. Each of these is a document that, if read thoroughly from beginning to ending would teach you everything you would need to know in order to play 36 different games which conform to [[What is a Game|this definition of what a game is]].

I have also, however, written a lot more than that over the course of this 100 days
