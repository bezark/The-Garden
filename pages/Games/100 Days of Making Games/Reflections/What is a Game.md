# What is a game?
I am very loose in my understanding of what games are, so in order for it to count as a game it all it needs is to meet the following criteria:

## A game is
An experience or artifact which
- Has a player or players who have identities and objectives
- Has a clear end condition
- Can be fully understood and executed by the players themselves.
 
## **An experience or artifact** 

Basically I am making either a physical object or a sequence of events. 

## **Has a player or players who have identities and objectives.**
I think that in any game a player has a sense of who they are and some sort of goal. Both of these can change over time I guess, but I don't think a game is really playable without these two criteria. Obviously there are games where you are just yourself, which is a totally valid option for a game. But the value in this rule is that it is the clearest mechanism for encapsulating story which is definitely something worth holding.

Perhaps a better way to phrase it is I have to clearly articulate the Object of the Game. I don't need to necessarily always articulate this explicitly to the player of the game (there can be great fun in revealing these things during a game) but I need to articulate it clearly in writing to myself during the design of the game.

## **Has a clear end condition**

Sounds simple, but articulating an ending condition is I think actually pretty important. It is always pretty clear when a game is over.

## **Can be fully understood and executed by the players themselves.**

This is VERY important: so often when I make games I notice that I'll change rules in my head or never write them down and in that sense they never actually get realized. So every game I make will have to have clearly defined rules that anyone can learn.

The most obvious way these might manifest themselves is through written text, but I will leave open the possibility to explain the game through audio, video or playable tutorials.

I think that's actually maybe it in terms of what criteria these creations need to be called games.
