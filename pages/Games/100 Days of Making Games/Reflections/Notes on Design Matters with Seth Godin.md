- Each idea is a bite sized morsel, aka an [[Atomic Note]]
-  Just write some thing for 100 days
	-  Books got PUBLISHED

The Practice is
- Choice
- Skill
- Attitude

When you talk to yourself it's a CONVERSATION
- and the person talking is afraid, a critic etc
- the listener is afraid but brilliant

The Practice is
- Merely doing the work. Without reward without grumbling without cowering
- The practice is agnostic about the outcome and remains regardless of the outcome

Learning from the work is different from trying to control the outcome of the work ^38e4d8

Great has nothing to do with popular

It's not about how MANY people engage
There are so many things to do- so many niches

If the need for critical and market success drives you, that's a great place to hide.

Sports is a great example:
- Michael Jordan only made 35% of shots. He failed most of the time.
- We play catch because we enjoy the PRACTICE

Ship your work
- If you don't ship your work, it doesn't count

[[Reassurance is futile]]

[[Capitalism]] has brainwashed us into thinking that the only thing that matters is the outcome.

It's ok to be a hack aka just do what the customer wants
Sometimes you just have to "be a design waitress"
What does it mean to live in a commercial world still bring ideas forward
There is no room for PURELY being an artiste

You get better clients by being a better you

If you're too busy too do something it's actually because you just don't want to
Imposter syndrome is a good signal that you are encountering difficulty.


The only way to enter a state of flow is to start working when you aren't in a flow state.


The magic is... there is no magic.
