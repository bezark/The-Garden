# Feedback
- Give clearer goals
- There was joy in knowing the formula
- factory table- 

Maybe you don't actually need roles
maybe it's moves
maybe there doesn't need to be dice
it feed back on itself so it gets easier
maybe you hit an edgeeee.'
It's a rp heavy game and and doesn't need

# Feelings
God that was fun. I'm really proud of myself. I'm fairly tired.
I'm really excited about the game, I have good questions from it like:
- What actually are the mechanics?
	- or rather, do the dice rolls help or hinder?
- How much variety does it have?
	- Is the turn on the wilder guaranteed?
		- is that a bad thing?
- How much flexibility is there in the universe?
- Is it repayable/ should it be?
- How can I still allow choices to get made and yet feel fair-
- Do others run into the same confusions I had with the Wilder?
- Do you really need all 4 stats?
- How do I adjust for the problem nic mentioned?

# Potential Adjustments
- Make the gate
- Remove an axis
- Add goals
- factory table
- Better help for the Wilder- more specific prompts on rooms
- How can there be a variety of challenges? Or do there need to be?

Next Steps:
- [ ] Make some changes [[2021-02-22]]
- [ ] make another playtest of mechanics [[2021-02-24]]
