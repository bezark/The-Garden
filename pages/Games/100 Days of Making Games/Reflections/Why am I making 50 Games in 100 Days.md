I'm trying to make 50 Games in 100 days!  [[ITP/100Days/Blog/TheGames/100 Days of Making Games]]
## What I want to do
- For 100 Days of Making I really want to focus on Game Design.
- Specifically, I don't really want to focus on the technicalities of working in any particular environment like Unity or Unreal and I don't even want to develop any particular type of game. 
- Rather, what I want to hone over the course of the 100 Days is my actual basic game design skills. 
- I want to work on devising fundamental game mechanics and concepts, and I want to really push myself to iterate and articulate constantly.
- In order to practice this skill, I want to make a new game every day for 100 days in a project I'm calling [[ITP/100Days/Blog/TheGames/100 Days of Making Games]].
- I want to end every day wit a new playable game. Now they don't have to be GOOD games, and they don't have to be COMPLEX games, but they should be fully playable.
## Why I want to do it
- I've always wanted to be a game designer, but often when trying to make a game I have come up against a familiar set of roadblocks.
- I frequently find myself coming up with a central game concept and mechanics in an initial spurt of creativity, but then I continue to cautiously revise and refine in ways that don't actually encourage growth- it's really easy to get sucked into adjusting minor values and twiddling parameters on a system that is inherently flawed.
- Another thing I struggle with in my creative practice is flattening- I have a lot of different ideas and possibilities floating around in my head, but I have a hard time deciding on any one course of action. In thinking about all the different possible choices I could make, I don't actually make any concrete choices. Additionally, I also worry too much about the product being 'good' or living up to my initial expectations.
- I think a great way for me to outgrow these patterns is to try and make a bunch of very bad games. In coming up with a new concept every day, I will have to embrace 'bad' ideas ie I will have to be very un-precious with what I think is a good concept worthy of my creative energy. Then, in writing out rules for these games I will have to force myself to fully articulate my ideas. Finally, by starting over again each day, I will become more comfortable letting go of old ideas that aren't actually serving me.
## The Rules
So this is all still sounding pretty vague, so here are some specific rules I will be following:
-  I will make a NEW game every 2 days for 100 days.

![[What is a Game]]

### Materials

It's also very important to me that I spend no money on any of the games and that each game can be fully played with standard game pieces or items that can be found around the house. 

### Revising
I recognize to that **making** a NEW game every day sound a little insane. Not only is it difficult, but there is great value in refining and revising something that already exists. I totally agree. That's why I will allow myself to take any mechanic or concept from previous games and bring them into a new game. But I really want to make sure I don't fall into the trap of making minor tweaks and revisions to something so if I'm going to reuse anything there has got to be a cost!

Each day I'll essentially be making a game that has all 4 of the following components: 
- Rules/Mechanics
- Character/Theme
- Objective
- End Condition

So I've decided that I can only ever keep 2 of those 4 components. If I really like the Mechanics and the Objective then I have to change the End condition and the theme. If I like the theme and the Objectives, then the rules and the end condition need to change. 

### Subsections
There are SO MANY types of games I am interested in making! Potential Subsections of the 100 Day challenge could include:
- RPGS
- 1 Player
- Multiplyaer
- Sports
- Digital
- Narrative
- Mechanic
- Playtesting

But I'm not really going to limit myself to any of this yet. 
## How I'm going to do it 
Through sheer force of will! And a carefully crafted daily routine that sets me up for success. 

Odd Days(First Day of Development):
- Brainstorm: 12
- Break: 3
- Iterate: 25
- Break: 5
- Articulate: 12
- Break: 3
- Post: 5

Even Days (Second Day of Development)
- Playtest: 12
- Break: 3
- Iterate: 12
- Break:3
- Playtest:10
- Break: 3
- Articulate:12
- Post: 5

So Yeah. That's what I'm thinking. Wish me luck!
