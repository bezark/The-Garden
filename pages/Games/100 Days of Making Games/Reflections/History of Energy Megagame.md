#itp/thesis #game/idea 
- Making a [[megagame]] as my final project either in [[Energy Class]] or [[Afrotectopian Ecologies]]
	- A game that pulls on the themes of [[The History of Capitalism is Energy Optimization]], [[Money is Energy]], [[Violence is Power]] and combines historical trends in the growth of civilizations with decolonial and futures thinking. 
	- An evolution from [[The Train Game]]

Sort of happened with [[Building Build a Town]] and [[The Owner of An English Coal Mine]]
