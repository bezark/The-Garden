So the trick with this game is to not over complicate it.

You are a Mine Owner, recently come into a mine and you can
- Hire workers
- Change wages
- Change hours
- Invest in technology
- Dig deeper

Definitely can dig deeper.

The progress of the game is measuerd in depth
The formula would be:

number of workers x hours worked x technologyscalar = progress made?

the structure wants to be a 'clicker', the question is how can I quickly prototype a clicker?

It's like text on screen and press button? Button generates progress?

What if it's just a fictional experience, a twine piece where you just move from thread to thread? when there are moments of repition perhaps it makes a random choice? I believe you can track values in twine and unlock certain things with different values? 

The goal is to create a real sort of narrative experience as the owner of the mine- one the is fraught with the problematic choices?

Copy:

The year is  and the world is ripe with possibility! You've recently come into a coal mine (inherited naturally) your decided to get into the coal business.

Your fortunes have shifted

3 workers perished in the mines today. 
Opening a sill and the water was in there

Whou would have thought that rivers ran beneath the earth!

How can you get past this????


A business man by the name of newcommen has been making the rounds lately- he's selling something he calls a steam enging? A pump house??


Ok so part of the problem here is  I don't really know enough to write this, but I suppose no one ever knows enough. I could easily prototype this.

The arc is:
- open a mine
- business is slow
- business grows
- workers grow
- accidnets
- water???
- a pump!
- Deeper! More money!
- coke
- A better pump
- More people
- Steam engines, the future
- The earth
