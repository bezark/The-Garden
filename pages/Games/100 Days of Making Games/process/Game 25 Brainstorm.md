My Idea for  this game is the following:
What if it's a choose your own path
you walk through the par
you enjoy the sunshine
there is a little bit of light exercise needed
you need to smell the grass
You need to fill a hole with ideas
You need to build up a distinc posibility of failure
there are real consequences to your actions in that the moment you shut your eyes the world sort of dissapears

There are a variety of different possoble mechanics like
shuffling cards drawing rangdom objects
draw a portrait.

Things you can do in a park on a suny day:
- draw
- throw a disk
- hide in locations
- run quickly
- touch your friends
- feel the earth
- tan
- drink water
- look at the green stuff
- walk around vigorously
	-	walk around less vigorously
-	Leave a blanket on the ground and make a fort out of it
-	THrow sticks back and forh
-	make ammends with a long lost friend 
-	call a loved on
-	just look at animals


Things I want to make still are:
- Sports
- Larps
	- Your wizards doing wizard battles
	- your a spy undercover
	- OOH you don't know who is playing the game and who is not playing the game
	- You need to figure out who is doing what
	- What if you need to make a house of sorts and LITERALLY WHY DO I ALWAYS SAY MAKE A HOUSE
	- What if you are building up a team
	- You are recruiting people to join your secret army

What are mechanics for resolving conflict in larps? 
- Hitting each other with foam things?
- Rolling dice
- using your words and talking about your feelings?
- Entering secret locations with answers only on the other side?
- Merging fact and fiction

If I were to make a park larp or a larp for the floor perhaps it could be played all week long and no one knew who was playing it
and you could infect people or pass secrets or some such through video chat or inperson communication
what if there was a thing that happened each day for seven days
there could be a little website that posted updates and new plot twists
A custom discord server with different thangs in it. Channels reflecting yadda yadda

What if it's a thing where people all have to solve a mystery over a long peroid of time
Where different characters are enforcing different parts of the story
Or what if there was a deciscion point where there were four different gatekeepers and you needed to appease all of them
what if there was a timer and you all were working for a boss
what if you needed to turn in a news article every day
What if the website was a news paper
IT's like a noir themed thing that people are playing through out

There's a murder and the murder needs to cover up the murded
there are detective looking for the murder
press looking for a scoop
politicians trying to play down their big timey thing
What i want to do is make a megagame basically
There are chances to build a house FUCK MEEEE I need to make an extension that deletes eveything I write everytime I write the sentence "build a house"
I think perhaps that comes from Keenan and The Man Who Built His House to Heaven which is a testament to their writing I guess

Anyway I think there is a situation possible where I spend the summer actually developing a megagame through the project sudion [[Summer Plans]]
That is a whole other ball game though
I would really like to hone in on this sprint the little game [[In Reverance of the Sun]]
