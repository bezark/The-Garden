Ideas:
- A card game for twelve people
	- everyone gets two cards
	- can walk around
	- pretending they are fancy folks
	- Or they all get to throw down cards in a different order
	- [[7 Types of Play]]
	- So what if it was a crad scavengar hunt
	- What if you were trying to trade cards with others and work your way up the social ladder
	- what if you had to change roles and jobs
	- what if there was a type of move that certain cards could do that others couldn't
	- What if there was a thing wher you needed to build a house
	- or complete some collective project 
	- all by playing cards in a sequence?
	- you all have to work together but someone is the traitor
	- what if there is series of challenges and people don't know what's happeining?
	- what if I make 3 card games to be played in three different locations?
	- what if there are different zones and you need to swap cards between the zones
	- I am admittedly ripping off two rooms and a boom
	- What if different cards have different apbilities
	- what if there are constraints on when you can go from place to place
	- what if you need a certain number of cards to get from one room to another
	- also what if there were a platform that were basically playingcards.io and wonder 
	-  What if there were a different type of game where you really were just playing different card games in different locations and 1 player had to beat several people playing at once and you took your hand with you from room to room
	-  What if there were all these switches
		-  like speed dating 
		-  or two big wheels rotating.
			-  gears in the maw of the card god
	-  what if there was a way to assemble a deck from the best possible cards
	-  You go around trading cards from hand to hand
	-  room to room and then you're trying to get the best possible poker hand?
	-  Or the most pairs
	-  like super old lady
		-  old maid?
		-  go fish.
		-  whatever
	-  what if there was a game where you could move between different places


What is the object of this game? I guess it's to switch cards
