# Megagame
- A card game for twelve people
	- everyone gets two cards
	- can walk around
	- pretending they are fancy folks
	- Or they all get to throw down cards in a different order
- what if I make 3 card games to be played in three different locations?
-  What if there were a different type of game where you really were just playing different card games in different locations and 1 player had to beat several people playing at once and you took your hand with you from room to room
-  **what if there was a way to assemble a deck from the best possible cards**
-  Work with a bunch of different locations
- put people in different rooms
- they need to find each other
- or you're two teams trying to find each other
- You have to communicate across a distance
- WHY NOT GET TECHNOLOgy IN DIS BIZZZZ
- You have a brief moment to talk to each other and then the window closes
- Maybe we're in boats sailing a see an you're trying to find each other

# Energy
What if you are a hunter gatherer and you're trying to get energy for your people

what if you're farming
what if you all need to gather food
Each turn is a season

[[Resource Management]]

Play a game where literal buy in determines power in game
where currency is unevenly distributed at the start of the game
where you play through different points in time and things become more efficient
what if the goal was to transition from a place of inequity to equality
or if different people had different goals at different points and the system was trying to bring them together
Like a co-op game but in reverse:
	- most table top coop games have you vs the system
	- something like dead of winter incentivizes going against the group
	What if the game was trying to bring you together somehow??
	Final ideas for the day- planting a field- a grid
- grid gets bigger over time
- competeing to fill in rows
- fill up a row and get a reward tile from the end
- hand of cards for different crop growing techniques

"What if each day there was a riddle and you could only advance if you got it right"
Wearing a hat. Something that makes you feel in charge
You get a hat and a cane.
Give away your props
give away factory parts
you need to build an armada of cards


I've been interested in voyages for a very long time
I've been interested in time too
BIG stretches of timer yawning out ad infinitumm 

But I like the idea of passing notes and onle player being the teacher
Kids have to hand notes off to each other
