Ideas for revising [[Six by Six Township]]

The biggest thing about the previous version was that there were not really enough [[routes to victory]]. I feel like this is a fairly common game design practice, perhaps even necessary. So no I will imagine other paths:

- Generating more money
- Making advanced manufacturing
- boosting moral with events
- beautifying the land with parks?
- increased farming

Perhaps there are ways to upgrade buildings- placing tiles on top of previous tiles and making things bigger and better

there could be a movie theater and a play house and a saloon.
Perhaps there are buildings that decrease your prestige but increase other aspects dramatically.

In generaly, it was more of a spatial puzzle than an economic engine builder which I didn't mind, but I want more.

So I think another are to improve on is the New Commers sections- maybe there are ways to make this more direct or more i don't know
like there are different areas of that board 
and there are different mechanisms for holding auctions
and if auctions felt more like auctions- like there was a competition between the two of you for who got to build what.
Maybe there are a certain number of buildings available, but what could you give up?
maybe you generate money ofer time and then you can either bid or buy buildings out right?
maybe there is a certain amount of moving down a track or something
or maybe there is an ability to find what you need in a network?
maybe you need to trick people that you are the right town.
Maybe your prestige is what allows you to pick the cream of the crop for buildings.
If your town is more desirable, you'll get first pick for buildings.
Maybe there are just certain buildings that can be built in a year.
and to the idea that you get to build if you are more prestigious,maybe there is an offset somehow....

I also like the idea of implementing ages that get ushered in by building specific buildings- bringing in a telegraph ushers in a new age that changes the rules for the towns and how they operate.
Maybe you get to upgrade certain buildings right out of the gate, each town gets a free upgrade or something.
There's also something exciting about bringing forests back
deforesting
relocating people
the idea that there are generice resources and then you find out later they are people.
multiple ages and each age zooms out in scale. Board gets bigger, just like Die Hard game.

There are horses and 'prime movers'

a question arises too in regards to [[Energy Class Discussion on The Morality of Energy]]- how can I adequately capture this idea about how [[Misunderstanding the Industrial Revolution]]- that these technoloogies STILL required vast amounts of human labor. [[Civilization Has Been Built on The Maximum of Human Capacity]]

Splendor is a good sample here:

I think there is something about making a market
