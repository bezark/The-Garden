        -   When to play some thing
        -   which card is the right card
        -   flip something over incorectly or correctly

It would be funny to "test the microphone" gy getting them to say squeak and then using that as the only sound that the other players heard when talking happened.

# First Pass at the Rules
-   Dr. Rablats Rablats is a game of creative communication between to furry friends
-   The object of the game is to work together to get all the way to the end of the 4th challenge without getting electrocuted!!

## You will need:
- These cards
- A timer
- A sheet of paper and something to write with

## Setup:
After printing out the cards and cutting them by what they say in the top left:
- Key cards 

## Gameplay

### Round Start
At the top of the round decide which rat will be the communicator and which will be the guesser.

The Guesser draws the first card from the index Deck.

The Communicator draws 3 cards from the current level deck. place them on the sheet of paper face down

The Communicator has 30 seconds to silently communicate which card is which shape.
At the end of the 30 Seconds, the Guesser must correctly draw the shapes below each card using the index card for reference. The only possible shapes in the round are on the index card.

If the Guesser guessed correctly, advance to the next round. If the guesser guessed incorrectly, try the current round again with three new cards.
Regardless of a success or failure, switch who is the guesser and who is the communicator.

### Advancing to the next round
Draw the next round's index card and place it next to the current index card. All the symbols on both cards are now possible.

Take the round 2 symbol cards and shuffle them into the round 1 cards. Draw 4 cards this time.

For the third round, discard all the cards and draw the round three index card and a hand of five symbol cards from the deck

For round 4 repeat similar to round 2 but draw 6 cards.

If you fail any round 3 times you get electrocuted by Dr. rablat!
