ok so there's a difference between things i want to do and things i feel like i need to do

I am interested in doing this larp night thing on the floor sometime soon
what if there was a game where we all had to run from room to room 
and you needed to solve riddles in each room
or you needed to socialize in each room
you need to be in a space alone with someone in order to convert them to specific roles
[[Do Your Homework]] but irl
part of the problem with that game was the timing- perhaps you can just eliminate that and make it so that you are just tapping people
or swapping things

Maybe someone is trying to smuggle something to someone else
there are 5 criminals at a party and they don't know who each other are
there are 2 detectives trying to catch the criminals
there are socialites who are tying to climb the ladder of success
this is all well worn ground but what have i run up against?
I've gotten THIS far in a lot of ideas for social games, I think the problem is I haven't played many large scale social games and I haven't had the ability to observe them being played
so maybe there's any easier way to go about it
make the game very simple

start with mafia- the mafia is trying to murder someone specific
they can only do so when un attended
why then would you be un attended?
you would want to go from room to room if you were collecting things
accomplisihg things in each room
writing a list
trading cards 
trading resources
trying to elope with people
trying to make a secret deal
another common structure is to have certain factions that denote certain things
groups and sub groups
if there is a board component where units are moved around perhaps it requires finding literal cards and abilities to be used in the process?
perhaps it's about gaining points
I remember the [[currency]] of the megagame at [[pax]] was mancala beads and they were used on actions 
there is something good and easy about a universal currency that can be expanded upon
there is also something about having different facilitatiors? But what's something that could be done easily?
without a lot of 'people'?
what would be the value?
Maybe if there were speakers in every room and you could have sound going back and forth
maybe there are 3 specific rooms that then have purposes- maybe we don't need to overcomplicate it.
I could give everyone a faction and identity ahead of time and assign roles
that would allow folks to come in costume
Maybe there would be the:
speakeasy
the race track thing
the police station?
the mob head quarters
what could happen in each space?
maybe there would be different people as different roles 
or like maybe we don't actually need to really come up with global objectives so much as specific little ones per player
maybe there is a way to let folks roam around. An [[Immersive experience]] 
This is sort of like my ideas for [[Steel Owl]] and the [[Mystery House]]
There is something in here for sure. Worth circling back to
