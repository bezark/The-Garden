# Ideas
- Work with a bunch of different locations
- put people in different rooms
- they need to find each other
- or you're two teams trying to find each other
- You have to communicate across a distance
- WHY NOT GET TECHNOLOgy IN DIS BIZZZZ
- You have a brief moment to talk to each other and then the window closes
- your giving a power point and you cant see what your doing
- your driving a person around
- ONe person wears a head cam and is a robot
- one person is a robot and the others are programming the robot
- like robo rally but with charades and a performer
- you are trying to get the person to escape the room
- you are making a little jelly bean
- you are building catapults 
- you need to twist and shout

two teams in opposite spaces 
maybe you are trying to sink each other
maybe you are trying to find eac other
these are old ideas. [[Hardship Scratch]] ideas!
also kind of [[Haunt That House Scratch]] ideas. Ideas about connecting people in disparate locations.....
but maybe there is some easy way to do it.
Maybe we're in boats sailing a see an you're trying to find each other

I've been interested in voyages for a very long time
I've been interested in time too
BIG stretches of timer yawning out ad infinitumm 

what about a think where there are distinct roles in a court
What about doing a mock trial
What about doing a walking club game club crossover

what about a thing where you are building a tower together and the other team is trying to nock it down

Maybe I'll just focus on making a team game this time.

4 v 4
or 2v2 
there is something fun about teamwork
laser tag
finding out things about each other
secrets and traitors
spies

maybe each team has a mole who is reporting things to the other team
maybe each team has a sabateur

2 rooms and a boom seems fun because it swaps folks so the rooms get mixed up

maybe ther are groups dancing together 
maybe there are people doing performative activities???
maybe there is a spelling bee
