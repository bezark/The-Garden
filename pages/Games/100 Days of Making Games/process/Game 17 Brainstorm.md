2 player card  game
trick taking
centered on conflict resolution
What if you are just trying to get out of a room
what if there is a planet in the center
what if you are waiting for something
there are types of cards that deal damage
you are trying to  overcome a challenge 
there is a way to do that with cards the higher card wins
you need to build an armada of cards
what if you have to vie for control of cards

you are building up something
you are trying to confront something

Where is this going
this comes from a hope to want to hone in on the center of the wonka game
why?
because I felt like that was successful?
why don't I just hone in on a two player card game
there are different potentials
 what if it's possible cards that get activated
 what if you're swimming around in options until the last possible moment when you aren't
 what if there are forks a plenty
 what if you are looking for something simple
