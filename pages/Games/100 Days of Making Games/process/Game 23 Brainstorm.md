Ideas floating around in my head

time
what if you wrote one sentence a day. Each sentence was a season 
every four days it's a year
It is a journal game from on point in time
A Year in the Life, A Life in the Year

It's a printable journal that has different events on different days
You just write a thing a day

certain events will take time and you write their conclusion into the future

This is kind of tied to the [[Letter Writing RPG]] and [[The Train Game]], two older projects

Sort of builds off of [[Thousand Year Old Vampire]] and [[Tell the Tale]]

Also connects to  [[Time]] and [[Deep Time]] and perhaps [[American History]]

What if you are a hunter gatherer and you're trying to get energy for your people

what if you're farming
what if you all need to gather food
Each turn is a season


Maybe there is [[Resource Management]] too.

On a seperat note, I should make pages for more game design concepts. And perhaps I should get the deck of cards for that book? Nah they have an app.

There could be different historical events that tie to different pages
or if there was a way to track the days somehow?

[[A Life in the Year]]
