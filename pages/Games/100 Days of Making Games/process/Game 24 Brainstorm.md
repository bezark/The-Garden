Ideas for where to go next:

- Make a sport in the park
- Make a hide and seek game
- make a game about money
- about the exchange of goods and services
- about traveling
- you need to all work together to find a certain tree in the park
- I'm hiding in the park and there's a hidden dial
- there are ways of moving money around that are hidden to most players
- money is energy the game
- you have a currency and you're trying to manipulate it
- returing a little to [[Manic Markets]]
  
  you need to exchange value among different players 
  everyone starts with a diferent amount of currency
  and the currency allows you to effect the rules of the game
  it allows you to buy things
  Basically income inequality the game
  
  I am thinking alot about [[Proof of Work]] and [[Proof of Stake]]- the whole thing about [[Crypto-Art]] is eating a lot of backlash at the moment and I'm interested again in [[Proportional Crypto Currency]] and how [[The History of Capitalism is Energy Optimization]].
  
  Is there a way to turn this into a game?
  Like is there a way to think about the exchange of units for work?
  Currency is a mechanism of storing [[The Garden/Energy]] in a transferable way. Thinking again about how [[Money is Energy]]
  Money is a Capictor in that sense. Are there other metaphors to be employed there?
  
  But this is all a field from where I'm meant to be placing my energy atm.

  [[Should Games Be Fair]]
  
  GAME IDEAS:
  Play a game where literal buy in determines power in game
  where currency is unevenly distributed at the start of the game
  where you play through different points in time and things become more efficient
  What if there's a way to build in a sort of trouble shooting mechanism
  what 
  a type of self correcting thing
  where the group was in charge
  what if the goal was to transition from a place of inequity to equality
  or if different people had different goals at different points and the system was trying to bring them together
  Like a co-op game but in reverse:
	- most table top coop games have you vs the system
	- something like dead of winter incentivizes going against the group
	  	What if the game was trying to bring you together somehow??
	  
	  Final ideas for the day- planting a field- a grid
- grid gets bigger over time
- competeing to fill in rows
- fill up a row and get a reward tile from the end
- hand of cards for different crop growing techniques
- Could i make this a [[LARP]] to be played in the park.
	- How do I make a larp???
