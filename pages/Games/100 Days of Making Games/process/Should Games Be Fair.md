This is connected to the idea that [[Board Games Inherently Reinforce Capitialism, Colonialism and Rescource Extraction]]

Games are supposed to feel fair. They're pernicious in that they perpetuate the myth that we live in a system where everyone has equal access to resources and capital. This is obviously not true, but the way we talk about money opportunity still sort of fundamentally sidesteps this issue. I know it's talked about, but it's not embodied I guess?

What I mean to say is that you wouldn't play a game where players got handed these cubes at the start:

A game with that sort of radical resource distribution would feel UNFAIR. Unless the players with less resources had an opportunity to gain more, or could somehow overpower or team up on the player with more.

Because playing a game is supposed to be fair and emulate the idea that if you work hard you can win. You can succeed at an accomplish-able thing, despite the odds. But IRL there are certain things outside the bounds of what is realistically possible because of unequal starting conditions. I am relatively confident that I will never own a sports team, for instance. That's not something I will ever really able to do, and yet there is still the pervasive idea that, no maybe it is possible if I just work hard enough. I know a lot of the language around this is changing, but still in games we center around these achievable things...because they're fun...

And the question then is why are they fun? Are they fun because we eVoLvEd that way and are darwiniannly predisposed to enjoy blood-sport selfishness and achievement? Or is that just a symptom of the capitalist system we are embedded in? Or some sort of mixture between the two?

Insert reference to that one 99% Invisible Episode about the history of Monopoly here.
