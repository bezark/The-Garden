Game:: [[Generation Ship Game]]
Date:: [[2021-06-17]]

Wow here I am again. Thinking about [[Games]] I guess. Waiting for thin

To align I think? Looking back at what I thought and now trying to really step back into it. 

Things I've been thinking about recently are the [[Chroniciling Mechanic]] from [[Oath]] which I find really intriguing- the ability for a game to impact a future game and for the setup state to be different each time. Or at leas for the tear down to impact the setup of the next game. Very elegant.

Also thinking about the way [[Oath]] tries to model the flow of [[History]]and such. How can I apply that to the way I am exploring [[500 Years]] or at least like the way a simple system can model generational change.

So to think about that for a bit:

what if there was a rule where each player had other players as kids?
what if you only had a small window of time when you were ther prime generation and could only make deciscions at that point?
What if you built a whole little city and in transformed itself over the ages?

But what about that is dependent on presumptions of preexisting systems?

A game where you are waiting for a bus
a game where the only rule is what has already been established.
Each generation gets to add one rule and change one rule.
And new players start the game at different times. And it's taught by the players of the game.

What if there is a simple goal like move the ball across the space, but basically each player shows up at a different time, and is taught the rules by the previous players, makes a few key choices and then has to teach the rules to a new player.

Like Telephone but programatically

Something about how we inherit expectations and understandings of the world from our parents etc.

What if there is a big bag of paper and each piece has a random event on it. 
You pull things from the bag and add things too the bag.

Each person can change what is in the bag.
And certain things in the bag trigger other things that are predetermined

Thinking again about [[Command and Control]] structures- are there automatic chain reactions? Certain [[Information Flows]]

What if there is a weight that we all have to lift?


There are larger questions emerging suddenly about what again is this process? ~~Why am I doing this~~ I'm actually not wondering WHY. The [[Focalin]] helps remove the pressure of why. Now the qiestion is WHAT and HOW. That is also less daunting than before, but still worth investigating. Or perhaps not, for it can easlily turn into [[Mistaking Motion For Action]]
