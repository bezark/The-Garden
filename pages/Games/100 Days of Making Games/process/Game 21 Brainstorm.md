Ideas for a game about going on a field trip:
- 1 person is the teacher
- everyone else is a student
- students are trying to catch the teacher
- students are trying to run away from the teacher
- students are trying to pass notes in class
- The teacher is trying to intercept those notes
- If a note makes it all the way around the class the students win?
- Are they also passing around real homework?
- There are secret messages happening?

I am combining the ideas dave had from [[Overthrow the Government]] and my thoughts about making a [[Virtual Field Trip to the Hall of African Mammals]]

I wonder if there is a way to stitch these two things together.

But I like the idea of passing notes and onle player being the teacher
Kids have to hand notes off to each other
What makes it hard? Teacher needs to get through course material? Can't have them looking at students all the time?

Students all have different things they're working on?
They all have assignments they have to complete?
This is also sort of a method for testing [[Ideal Virtual Field Trip Teacher Controls]] so perhaps there's more stuff about exploring a space
maybe you need to run around
maybe you need to hide and be found
Red light green light?
Balance controls:

| Teacher Can      | Teaher Can't    |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| See Birds eye    | Move easily     |
| Hear Selectively | Hear everything |
| Freeze people    | Freeze multiple |
