In a game for a friend wish them a very happy birthday
but then tell them a true fact about every year they were alice

you're throwing a birthday party and you mus invite all the right people
you have to find the surprise party you need to ambush the host
there are different rooms you go to and each one has a different host in it

you can visit the cat room or the dog room 
your an egg cooking in the pan
your goal is to become hard boiled
you need to crack on the surface

There are hot pockets and you must answer them
you make phone calls to random strangers
go on quarentine chat and pretend to be a friend of yours
go out in the world
Be somebody else for a day- give yourself a new name and a new identity
a secret about yourself only you know
make a deck of cards for every year you were alive
or a card for every year of your life.
Shuffle them together
deal them out and try to stack tocether similar years
wwrite out common themes
there are a variety of suits on for friends and family

the object of the game is to write the friend a really nice letter 
to get them a good gift
tell them a secret that you've been too scared to do
Call one person from a previous birthday

set them up and act it out

You are sacred.
