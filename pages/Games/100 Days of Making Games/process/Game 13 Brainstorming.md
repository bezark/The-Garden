This is for [[Anticipate-A-Day]]
Thinking about [[Tarrot]], [[Cards]], Daily  Rituals

What if each day you had to answer a question
What if each day there was a riddle and you could only advance if you got it right
You got a high score

I have [[The Garden/Questions about what is a narrative]]

[[The Garden/Stories in 7 Frames]]

Questions I have:
- Is it a sequence of 7 or a sequence of 14?
- Is it [[linear]], [[Forking Paths]], [[Random]] or [[The Garden/Procederal]]?


[[The House/Projects/Anticipate a Day Thematic Ideas]]

Game is going to be called [[Sigil Story]]
