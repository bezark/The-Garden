Again here thinking of ideas.

Ok so i want to hone in on this concept of [[Deep Time]] and Community and imagining futures and [[Money is Energy]] [[The History of Capitalism is Energy Optimization]] etc..


So what I think I want to make is a group based communal rpg

We all play as villagers in a town
We move through time
Is it pre-industrial? Is it [[Post-Apocalypse]]

What does it actually look like?
I think there are players in a group
you come up with perhaps a family or a section of society
this is pulling from [[Legacy Life Among the Ruins]]
But perhaps you are all in agreement about what sort of government you have
or town rules?
Perhaps you'r just working to grow your town
and the world changes around you 
again referencing the [[Train Game]] here but yeah I liked this idea of being in a group together collaboratively building a little town and watching it change over time

perhaps it starts at the incorporation of a town.
You start by writing the town charter
you elect a mayor
there are different boards.
Different things that come up to your town.
It is possible to make choices about what is and is not allowed?

This is again simulating capitalism I think but perhaps there is value in doing so with intention.....


But how does the town grow?
How do you make changes to the town over time?
what technology doe the town encounter?
How do you encounter large scale issues in little moments

Ok so this is a field

Mechanics:
draw from a deck of cards- an event deck
Have a literal board that has different plots of  land
develop those plots as tiles
gain resources
move things from one place to another

see things grow
there are moments of growth and collapse ^70a334

mechanics:
what if you all have town meetings every night
what if you are passing a law that changes the rules of the game

There is a currency that then gets dispersed differently

people are villagers and also board members

what if there is a house building CONTESTS~!!!N!J!:LKN omg 

What about the seasons and the weather


This is my classic dilemma- how to make a total simulacrum of the evolution of our world and put it into a game. 

I don't know. But I think Zooming in on one facet of that is the way to do it.
Maybe just make a game about town council.

Your a town.
You elect a mayor.
There are zones.
The zones produce goods and value over time
there are common spaces and private spaces
taxes and codes.
There are different imports and exports
There are ways of trading between towns (getting ahead of my self)
You are a group of people imaging a better world. ^7246e0
