Building off of [[Build a Town]] and [[On the Map]]

There is a 6x6 board of spaces
each space is a hectare of land that can be assigned.

Buildings produce resources every turn
so farms produce one food
stores produce money but need materials
mines produce iron and coal
mills produce advanced goods
church improves image of town

Vilalgers need to be enticed- your town needs to have certain elements
you place tiles.
You don't need to 'pay food' all the dang time.

Perhaps depending on the adjacency of tiles neighbors get upset.
	borrowing heavily from sim city
Also there was a mechanic for discovering iron- 6 and 6.
Or I guess you could roll two d6.
Then roll a d4- that determines how much iron there is
then per adjacent orthagonal space, rolla gain. If the result is <= the number of iron in the original space, add an iron
	this simulates a sens of naturally spreading veins etc. 
	kind of a [[Conway's Game of Life]] dealio

The key is to get away from the minutia of collecting things all the time.
maybe just by being adjacent you can have things.
So you can have a house only if adjacent to a farm.
You can have a store only if adjacent to 3 farms
you can have a church if there are 4 houses
you can only have 3 houses per farm.

Basically instead of making you do the counting back and forth, just make the tiles themselves show the relationship

Then make new tiles!

I would love to figure out how to make custom tiles online

Maybe too you can only really do one thing on a turn. Build a building etc.

Then when people come through there is a bidding war to get them to arrive?

The ultimate goal is to get the railroad to come to your town.

Attractions are:
- church
- Salloon
- Smith
- Store
- Post office


I've listed these before. But it's helpful to think about them in terms of:
- what they require
- what they produce
- How they need to be placed.

Logging: remove one tree from the board at large. 

Basically make a bunch of tiles!
Then there needs to be changes and Events
and a realtionship between towns.

Maybe focus on the two player version again and THEN expand to give other roles.
But roles could be:
- running the sotre
- being mayor
- Train 

I wrote these in earlier version.

COMPILE this all some how in to rules!!!
