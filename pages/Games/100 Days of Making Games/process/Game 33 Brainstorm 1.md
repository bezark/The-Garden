For this version of build a town I guess there are a couple of different dirctions to go in:
- refining the existing thing
- somewhere new

NEw territory means more story
more time
larger scope

a nother version of a role playing game where each round is a town meeting
Role playing as a town zoning meeting
then things happen. You have different documents that lead to different narrative outcomes

Basically tell the story through meeting charts.

to refine the existing things

- combining [[Build a Town]] and [[On the Map]]- you transition from one mode to another 
- at first you're just trying to build a town hall but once you doo you zoom out and can start constructing larger things

Other ways to build things could mean getting clay and bricks and stuff
- that would mean perhaps different territory
- Maybe there's a dig for clay mechanic?
- maybe there is a fill in holes thing
- maybe it's a type of game where you are holding shovels
-

You need more resources to win
you need to do the first part and then the second part

clay pits give you clay
kiln makes bricks
certain buildings need bricks
others could just be clay

the currency is interesting- why currency?
perhaps instead of paying everyone all the time you just sort of need to pay once a year?
I didn't actually play on the map, maybe i should play it a bit.

I think there is a way to do foraging.
Buildings and currencies:
- wood
- clay 
- wheat
- iron
- food 
- money
- animals
- labor

- house
- hall
- store house
- kiln
- windmill
- trainstation
- hotel

There are buildings and then actions

I want more characters- who are these people? what do they want?
I want both the mechanics of building a town AND the story of it
I would like to find a middle ground, so perhaps that means building out the world

Go back to cooperative. Give people roles. That's what benny suggested. Is there a way to make the game coop
to make on the map coop and more about managing people?
More about taking care of different things?

How do we get to a big town together?
Make people different roles
Give them JOBS you can get aka specific actions.
You get to pick a job once we build  the town.

JOBS are:
- planner
- mayor
- farmer
- stor owner 
- banker
- post master

Each job gets a different way of interacting with all thse agents etc all these little invisible buddies
or all these mini games essentially. That is interesting
