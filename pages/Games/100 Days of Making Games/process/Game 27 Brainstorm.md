So Ok Ideas  for this game are:
I want to explore [[Networks]] and I want to reeally see what it's like to pass things along
- like messages in a system
- or create chain reactions

I'm also interested still in all this Energy stuff- [[The History of Energy]] and all those adjacent ideas
That like maybe we use energy differently over time?
what if it's an engine builder and you get significantly more access to things over time
what if it's a famring simulator that takes a full day to complete
what if you're all in ta village and you're spreading gossip
what if youre creating a town set of rules and you're passing them on from generation to generation
there was this wonderful moment in the [[Thief and the Cobbler]] where these barbarians dug this tome out of the sand. They literally couldn't function without this written code this ancient lore. They were weirdly european and I wondered how they got there. There's something marevoluous about digging up ancient lore and written rules. Following instructions left by previous generations
- What if the 'world' had ended ([[It is easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism]]? ) and there is no more systems in place and you're all trying to guess the rules that are in place that govern symbolic experience. 

You're trying to agree upon a shared reality- you're all in different dimensions or at least have no common language

What if you're all little neurons and are trying to fire toether
what if you have different cards in your hand that represent different languages

What if you each percieve the world in different ways
what if there are down sides?
what if there is a match that needs to be lit?
What if there is a bafth that you need to take

there are volcanoes that go off
a trading card game where everything gets destroyed at the end
a performance where you play this game and then all the pieces get set on fire
A tapered hat that puts you in a house
You've just arrived at wizard school and the world is foreign to you

Something about the shadow of objective reality? About how we only encounter the shadows of objects and never the objects themselves?
We try ti KNOW things, but there are many experiences outside the bounds of knowledge.

What if you could play that some how? What if there was a way to not know the universe.

Games of the board variety always (as a norm) have to fully explain the rules to you before you play. Not so with legacy games

A game where the rules are unknown. There are examples of this (whatever that god card game is)

What if you are a little fish in a school and you're trying to steer the school without veering from the flock

How can I make 'boids' the game? Perhaps you're playing along side virtual fish

Maybe there is a flock and you're steering it? Maybe one player is a fish and has to blend in with the boids and another person is the sharck and has to find the outlier
