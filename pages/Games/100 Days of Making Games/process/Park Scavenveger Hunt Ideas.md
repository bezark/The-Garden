[[ARG]] [[LARP]] [[Scavenger hunt]]
- Could i make this a [[LARP]] to be played in the park.
	- How do I make a larp???
- If there is on person on top of look out hill, or several up there
 and there are people running through the woods
 It would be really nice to do a little web adventure through the park. Maybe just qr code stickers
would love to print stickers
maybe you need to just get all the pieces of a story.
Maybe when you go to a location you find videos of things filmed at that location
sort of overlaid
you encounter memories of something gone.
Your trying to find a lost object like a ring or something.
that is totally hidden and can be entered at anypoint.
I like the idea of using camera codes. or picture recognitions
Something like a qr code but nicer. Something that can be a little more subtly hidden.
like a geocaching narrative that exists
Go to the park, find this spot. Post a picture of it on the gram as a person who is missing or something. Basically put an invitation out there and see who takes it up

Ok so if i am thinking baout making a game in the park what actually does that entail?
A simple version would be a [[Scavenger hunt]]/[[geocaching]] sp? where you just look around for 3 different locations.
It's a map and when you get close to a dropped pin you recieve information
maybe even the simplest is that if you arrive at 3 locations you get info

Even simpler:
- [ ] Make a map
- [ ] Put pins on it
- [ ] Tapping on pins pulls up content
- [ ] arriving at locations checks box
- [ ] Track history with a cookie
- [ ] That's it!

More Elaborate Ideas:
- You get connected to a partner and anonmyously text like the [[R and J Game]]
- you schedule an appointment to actually meet someone as a finale
- you need to solev various riddeles
- You can go to any location in any order
- you can review memories that are from a ghost a la [[The Ghost Radio Arcade]]

( I should make a list of all the projects I've done and what they were about or exploring)

- You need to help a literal animal
- bring birdseed
- if you could take photos and then do image recognition
- or enter text and do text understanding
- Or if you could just answer questions that responded to certain things....
- I'm looking for some mechanism 
- maybe you do flat stanely and take a photo of an object in a location
- maybe you are reenacting a memory so you have to film yourself saying lines in a script 
	- and then you get edited in somehow
- Maybe you are foreced to cook a dish
- or have a literal picnic
- Maybe by tweeting about it you get contacted by a spirit
- maybe you and your friends are cometiting detectives
- or you role play a couple on a date 
- or you are looking for a person who went missing
- You retrace their footsteps
- I really like the idea of watching videos or hearing audio at the place where you are physically located THAT is an old [[The Ghost Radio Arcade]] idea for sure
- But I like it.
- You find different little books
- Poems written by an old writer. Who can't find their work any more
- Ghost writer. You're helping a literal ghost finish their poems. Oh you walk around the park and you are helping a ghost finish a poem. Go to each location and fill in the poem.

You need to complete rhymes!
You need to rhyme about a certain thing and then you help the ghost figure it out. That's cute.
Rhyming as a mechanic for puzzle solving. 
So like I looked up at the , my 



[[LARP]]- what about a scavenger hunt where the map gets handed off one by one- and interpreted one by one. What if There is a
