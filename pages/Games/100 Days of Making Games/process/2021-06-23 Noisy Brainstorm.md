Game:: [[Generation Ship Game]]

Thinking again about this game. There are two teams- each is trying to acomplish something simple and can change one rule a turn. They get five turns before they die. 
On their third turn a new player is born into their team and they can watch the game and the rules and ask questions and then they take a turn and then they pass on

The changes to the structure of the game should be dramatic in scope- totally redefining the goal of the game and the shape of it.

Once the player has died they leave the room and go back to the waiting area and get in the back of the line. They wait to be reborn
Ideally by the time they return to the game it has changed substantially since they last saw it.

there are different rules for different scenarios or once certain triggers are hit the game gets forked into different states. there are sort of [[Feedback Loop]] type state changes? ^b6ed13

A very obvious thing to try and apply to this would be some sort of generational challenge like climate change etc.

Or! Perhaps there are just THINGS that EMERGE from the generational play. LIKE climate change begins to appear in the world IF things are happening, but that is never STATED or a GOAL of the game. 

The main thing ABOUT the game is that there is NO objective knowledge- everything you learn about how the game works and is played happens DURING gameplay and that's all you get.

As a reult, it ought to be very simple.

This idea about emerging climate change- like if you emphasize one goal for too long, another challenge emerges- it builds off itself somehow.

Like a phase change etc. What are other skins for the game thought that would make it easier to develop?
You're all blind little mice and there is a big cat
your all little robots in a robot world. You start in a factory
in some sense this is also larping [[Plato's Cave]] I guess

So maybe it's literally a plato's cave situation
maybe it's just little dark rooms etc.
Maybe it's about fish
maybe you're light headed towards earth

what if you are interacting with earth but from across the galaxy so everything you learn about it is 500 years out of date
or basically you recieve radio transmissions and tv broadcasts from the past
what if you get to see what players are doing but it's actually like 10 turns behind where things currently are.
