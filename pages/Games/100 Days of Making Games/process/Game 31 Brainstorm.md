Response to [[Build a Town]] and [[Race to Build a Town]]:
It seems like there are a couple areas to improve in:
- the choices available to players when doing game stuff
	- Shouldn't be turns where you don't have options
	- shouldn't be seasons where you can't do certain things.
	- It should always feel like you're doing things of value
	- and this really shouldn't be the result of random chance
	- Essentailly I think foraging should be split into several actions
	- Perhaps there is a way to determine what you get when you forage
		- The amount is random but you can always decide?
- There should also maybe be more balance in the incentives for the different buildings:
	- Seems like the mill might be overpowered
	- seems like the store house under powered.
- It would also be nice if the buildings DID more
	- why is your house JUST a passive benefit
- Also it could be nice if there are more routes to victory
- and more ways when competing to interfere
	- IF that's the point here which is certainly kind of questionable
- Also the currency wants to be worked out a little bit:
	- The paying 8 food thing is a little nuts

So there are sort of incremental balancing type improvements

Then there are expansions of scope.
I would love it if this really felt like the Act 1 of a game and once you got things going sufficiently you could idual wheat you could harvest bundels which were units of four food

Also I want to really kind of expand the feeling of building a town. Buildings in a town are:
- Town Hall
- The LAW
- Hotels
- General Stores
- Transportation hubs too outside world
- post office
- farms
- libraries
- schools
- bars
- attractions and businesses
- stores
- manufacturing 
- houses
- parks and wild life
- social services
- senior living
- offices
- entertainment

There could be different parts that get different things going
Or rather it could be exciting to shift into different phases

once you build town hall you unlock different buildings
You gain the ability to dig for resources

this is a mechanic used nicely in Valhein where you unlock the ability to mine as your go

Perhaps there's a basic little technology tree

I know this is all pretty capitalist
I wonder how I can mix in different elements like role playing
