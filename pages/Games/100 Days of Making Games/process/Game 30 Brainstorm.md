This is an evolution of [[Build a Town]] and [[The Train Game]]

[[2021-03-27]]

Currently the game feels fairly punative 
which I sort of like, but it also seems like a real grind. and not necessarily one where it's easy to recover
I guess it's not the difficulty- it's the randomness. Forraging is really kind of a gamble. Which I like
Maybe there is a way to always just get one food?

It felt really difficult to try and get the food stored over the winter-
I actually found that too hard and cut the rule, but it would be good to try this again with the rule.

I really want to expand the game now and make it about two dueling towns
Perhaps put them on a board and make them compete
Give them the same number of resources that they are fighting over and make them race to complete the town.

# Different buildings should be:
- windmills
- watermills
- stores
- post offices
- train stations
- roads
- hotels
- factory
- construction place

# Different natural features could be:
- rivers
- clay pits
- forests
- grass land
- mountains

# Thoughts 
This is all familiar territory- the question is where do I go with this, how do I expand?
I think one route is to keep playing around with teams

another is to make story events
make more seasonal things- a winter deck
a deck for all seasons
a deck for the years
new events happen every couple of years

inter town trading- a market of bartering
returning to the actual train game- there could be different towns with different specialities.
There were really a lot of differen buildings in that- it would be worth it to return to those systems

The resources were:
- Wood
- Clay 
- Wheat
- Iron? 

- Cattle and hides

I want to send messages back and forth again

I want to transform a landscape again
I am building from [[Agricola]] and am wondering if I am taking enough????/

The goal could still be to build town hall
OR build the nicest town- points for certain buildings, points for certain patterns

perhaps your town becomes attractive and it gets people to come to it
Perhaps you can inccorporate and create taxes
Make a town charter
(Look into the history of small towns)
Make it so that there are a variety of different ways to climb up some arbitratry ladder
shipping and handling
Make it so that there are different animals to TAME wowowowow

Fix the plummimbg systems 
clean house
