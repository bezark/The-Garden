What if it's a simple game played by two people in space
you throw a ball back and forth
you dance a silly dance
what if it's a party game


Interpretative Dance Contest is a Party Game
You're given 3 words and you need to do an interpretative dance that best describes those words

What if it's totally dance based communication

You get cards giving you assignments for the fanciest dance 

There are judges who have to give scores in random arbitrary categories and they get penalized for being better or worse judges
You also could be trying to guess the theme of the piece

Ooh you could also be a drama critic
maybe a large group has to do a play and you have to write a review
maybe it's an improve contest?

Interpretative dance is fun because it's very silly

- Do a dance
- Come up with a headline 
- write a poem
- recite a poem
- do another dance?

Maybe there are roles: dancer, choreographer, critic and funder and they all rotate
or you pass one thing off to the other

I like that the critics are penalized for being out of line

and I like that the dancer has weird words to choose from

I think the structure is:


[[Very Fancy Very Serious Interpretive Dance Contest]]

This would be really good to mock up in tracery.js

also [synonyms npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/synonyms)


Have to resist the urge to build this out as a standalone app lol it's very easy to want to do that.
