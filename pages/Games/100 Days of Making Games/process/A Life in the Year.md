A life in the year is a journal based [[ttrpg]] played by 1 or more people over the course of 1 full year.

This is a game about [[Deep Time]], [[History]] and movements through life.

Each actual day you play the game represents one whole season in a year of the life of your character.

Print out the following document:

![[The Garden/Games/100 Days of Making Games/process/LifeinTheYear.pdf]]

Start by picking a year for your game to take place in. Write that year in the top left corner of the top left square on your first sheet. 

Every day you play the game write one sentence describing what happened to your character in the season of that year. Every four days, a year has passed! Write your new age in the bottom right corner. On the day after, write the new year in the top left corner. Your first year might look something like this:

You can only write one short sentence in each box, so really try to write the most important thing that would have happened to your character or in the world of your character in that particular season. Think about what changes may have taken place in the world as the years pass by. What major events unfold? What new technology or trends emerge? Who enters your life and who exits? *A Life in the Year* is a game about the broad swathes of life, so think about the big picture stuff.



If something will take seasons or years to accomplish, you can track the journey drawing a line across several boxes connecting the outset of the task to the conclusion of it. Add symbols along the line to denote setbacks or success. Here's an example:

Playing through a full 4 sheets will take you 360 days and will make your character 90 years old. You don't have to play until that age- your character may die before or after that arbitrary age. If your character dies before a full year has passed  and you want to keep playing, you can continue playing as a new character related to the first- an offspring, a friend or even enemy. 

When you've finished a full year feel free to read over your grand tapestry! (You can also play a shorter game by writing a number of seasons in one day, but doing more than 4 a day is not advised- it's hard for us to fathom the passage of time!)
