*Making Money From Nothing* is sort of a game, moreso an expereimnt. 

You will need a whole bunch of tokens of two different colors
Pick one type of token to represent money. Distrubute the money randomly and unevenly.

If you're wealthy, the object of the game is to buy a mansion for 30 money cubes.
If you're note wealthy the goal is to buy a house for 8 money cubes

%%Also distribute three blank cards to each player. Each player may invent goods to sell by simply writing the thing they wish to sell on the card and selling it to the highest bidder%%

The other cubes are "products". In order to generate a product cube, a player simply needs to do 40 jumping jacks.

6 product cubes may be sold to the bank for 4 money cubes.

Players may purchase a store for 10 money cubes- stores can have up to 3 people working in them. Anyone working in the store produces a product cube ate a rate of 20 jumping jacks per cube. The cube goes to the store's owner. It is up to the owner and employees to determine the wages worked for.

Factories may also be purchased- those cost 20 money, prododuce products for just 10 jumping jacks and can have up to 6 workers.

Use a shared writing surface to keep track of who owns what.
Money and products can be exchanged freely between players for any purpose.
