Monster Conference is a party game for 5+ peopleto be played online with a proximity audio enabled platform like wonder, yorb or gathertown.
Each player will need a piece of paper and something to write with

# Setup
For every five players, make one type of monster- vampire werewolf, mummy etc.

*For example: in a 5 -9 player game have 1 vampire, in a 10-14 player game have one vampire and one zombie, in a 15-19 player game have one vampire, one zombie and one mummy etc...*

Agree as a group on gestures and sounds for each monster-
*For example, zombies might outstretch arms and shout "Braaaaiiinsss", Vampires might hiss and make claws*

Select one player to function as the Conference Organizer. The conference organizer then secretly determines which players starts as a monster and informs them. The conference organizer then informs the other players that they are Business Buddies and infroms them what the conference they are attending is about. The conference theme should be fun to role play but difficult for the monsters to guess.

Each player come up with your BlinkedBlin Username. Something professional like GoodManager420 or CoolGuyHotSauce. Think too of who you are at this conference and what you want

The conference organiser then sets and start a timer equal to the number of players.

%%Then any monsters MUST MUTE their audio. For the rest of the game%%

# Gameplay

## Business Buddies:
You're are all here to network and make really good business connnections. Make your way through the conference and try and make BlinkedBlin Connections with all the cool Business Buddies! To make a connection, simply write down usernames on your paper. Wow what a cool connection! At the end of the game, you will get one point for every connection you made with an actual Business Buddy. But be discerning! You will LOSE one point for every connection you have with a stinky monster. If you think you made a connection with a monster, you can always delete it (just scratch it out)

The Business Buddy at the end of the game with the highest score will be awarded the "Best BusinessBuddy" trophy.

If you get attacked by a monster- You'e a monster now that's it! NO cheating. Your goal now is to work with the other monsters and make new monsters.

If you suspect someone at the conference is actually a monster, there's a couple of things you can do, namely:
1) Run away.
2) Confront them! Get another Business Buddy and confront them. If two or more Business Buddies simultaneously say "are you a monster?" to a monster in question, the monster in question must answer honestly. If they are a monster they must repent their monsterous ways and become a normal Business Buddy.

## Monsters:
Monsters: you're here to MESS. SHIT. UP. MONSTER STYLE. Try to turn as many Business Buddies as possible into your kind. If you run across a Business Buddy on their own, make your monstrous sounds at them and they will turn into a monster.

But be careful: if two Business Buddies confront you at once, you must repent your monsterous ways and become a Business Buddy like them. How boring.

Try to turn as many Business Buddies into your kind as possible.

If two monsters attack each other there's a monster SHOWDOWN aka they play rock paper scissors. The winner turns the loser into their kind.

If there are multiple monsters, the most of one type of monster at the end of the game will be the SUPREME MONSTER! If there is only one monster, you win if you turn the whole conference into mosnters!
