# Notes
A->B
The question about post-its removing other dots came up
the elitism fell question was a little silly
Adding systems may have been complicated?
Wants to be more fun/character focused
A lot of arrows....


# Post Game Questions
## What was the most frustrating moment or aspect of what you just played?
- Want it to go faster? Like the turns? Limiting the size? The game was  kind of openended? It was a little hard to conceptualize what the actions were. Feeling a little uncertain about the time frame made it weird to gague other players
	- 20 year jumps etc.
- The arrows were frusterating. but they were nice with dependencies
- There wasn't enough to focus on while waiting. 
- Wanted many  more boundaries
	- Had no connection to anyone else?
- No sense of unifying concepts
- A first it didn't feel like we were all in the same world
- The human eneded things were a little opene ended

- Perhaps the human level could be more seperate from 

## What was your favorite moment or aspect of what you just played?

- Was nice when it was fast
## Was there anything you wanted to do that you couldn’t?

## If you had a magic wand to wave, and you could change, add, or remove anything from the experience, what would it be?
- The switch from 1 to 3 dots was good 

- i wonder what pre-set system boxes could do for the game

- From Cat/Milo Bezark (they/them) to Everyone:  09:12 PM
- One boundary that could help would be - your turn could/should be in relation to one of the power dots the previous player added/ moved, or deleted from


The jumping from large to small scale <- if the sentence/actions were limited to what a person or body of people can do it would be easier to then think about “where am I in relation to this?"


## What were you doing in the experience?

## How would you describe this game to your friends and family?

Building off one another was exciting, so perhaps there's a way that the postits intertacts and you can only use postists

Was  sort of us centric? 
What is the scope of the actions? Are there things that are too big to say in one action???

Perhaps there needs to be a shared scope

**any action that can be done by a single person or body of people**

what if you were different structures at different scales. 


What if you paused at the end of every round and took stock of the world
