![[Magical Candy Factory.png]]
Magical Candy Factory is a One shot [[ttrpg]] for 4-8 players.

The first thing to know about Magical Candy Factory is that it is sort of like a traditional Table Top Role Playing game: *Sort of* in the sense that several players plays as characters (Kids) and one player plays as a Game Master of Sorts. What makes Magical Candy Factory different is that this other player is not an omnipotent force in the world, rather they are just a very powerful character- they play as the Owner of the Candy factory. In stead of referring to them as the GM, they are the GW aka the Gene Wilder aka the Wilder.

## The Premise
The eccentric owner of a World Famous and highly mysterious Candy Factory has invited 3-7 Special Kids to a once in a lifetime tour of their Candy Factory. But why???

## The Object of the Game
The Kids and the Wilder have slightly different objectives.
### Object of the game for the kids
-   You've heard rumor that the owner is getting ready to retire and is looking for a suitable heir.. maybe it could be you?
-   Or maybe you're just here to stuff as much candy as possible into your little kid tummy.
### Object of the game for the Wilder:
-   Find a suitable heir to your candy factory.
-   Dispose of everyone else.
-   And if you can't find a suitable heir... dispose of everyone? Maybe it's not time to retire.
## Setup
The Wilder and the Kids should each take the following steps to prepare.
### The Wilder
-   Whats your name? What's the name of your Candy Factory?
-   How did you select each of these kids?
-   How did you inform them?
	-   Golden ticket?
	-   Monkey delivery?
-   With 8 index cards Create 8 rooms. Write the name of the room on one side and a number with a circle around it on the other. This is a "floor" in the factory.
	-   Each room should contain one "challenge" for the kids-
		-   Examples are there's a river of chocolate and the door is on the other side.
		-   Envision challenges that will test the four basic attributes of the game (see below)
-   Then take Dumpa Lumpa tokens equal to the number of Kids-1.
-   Take 2 "Trick up the sleeve" tokens.
### The Kids
-   Why is a trip to this candy factory so important to you?
-   Use the table to generate a character. Roll a D6 three times and disperse the points however you choose to fill in the blank:
-   You are an ADJECTIVE , NOUN, THIRD THING.
 Or come up with someone else!
  
  ADJECTIVES
   1. Snot-nosed
   2. Too-good-for-this-world
   3. Funny lookin'
   4. Sweet-toothed
   5. Foul-Mouthed
   6. Blushy Gushy
	
  NOUN
  1. Orphan
  2. Rich Kid
  3. Mamas Boi
  4. Bully
  5. Sugar Addict
  6. Mathlete
  
  THIRD THING
1. with a heart of gold
2. with eyes bigger than your stomach. 
3. who watches way too much tv
4. with a mean left hook
5. who knows how to EAT
6. who is secretly as spy for Slugworth!

-   Establish a relationship with each of the other kids. How do you know each other. Or do you?
-   Each kid should print out the following stat card and place one token wherever feels right on each box to determine their starting stats.

The Four basic attributes of the game are:
- Sweet: Kindness, generosity, patience, helping others etc.
- Sour: Selfishness, ambition, cunning etc.
- Crunchy: Strength, Constitution, Reflexes trusting your gut etc.
- Chewy: Intelligence, brains, strategy, cleverness etc.

Sweet and Sour are diametrically opposed as are Crunchy and Chewy. You can be a +2 Sweet but that means you will also be a -2 Sour. Over the course of the game you can change these stats by moving your marker closer towards one or the other, but the pairs will always remain linked.

## Basic Principles
The Wilder is the Owner of this Candy Factory and as such, they have complete control over the physical environment. Every time the characters enter a new space, the Wilder begins by describing whats in it, what it looks like etc. The other players can suggest things if they're excited, but ultimately the WIlder decides what is and is not physically present in each room.

### Actions

Since the Wilder is also the only adult in the group, the Wilder also is responsible for evaluating the reckless actions of the Kids. Any time a Kid attempts to do something  where the outcome of their action is uncertain, the Wilder declares which of the four attributes that calls upon: Sweet, Sour, Crunchy or Chewy. 

The Kid and the Wilder then each roll a six sided dice. The Kid then adds or subtracts the relevant stat.

The Wilder may spend a Trick up the sleeve to add +1 to their role. They discard any spent Tricks.

Then the Doompas Bloompas show up!

The Wilder may disperse any unclaimed Doompas however they see fit. Each Doompa adds +1 to either the Wilder or the Kid. 

If the Kid's score equals or surpasses the Wilders, the Kid succeeds at the action. The Kid and the Wilder collaborate to describe what the success looks like.

If the Kid fails the action the Wilder describes the outcome.

Either way, the kid then moves their stat cube one space towards the stat that was just tested.

### Challenges
Each room in the factory has a challenge that must be surpassed before moving on to the next room. Challenges are resolved by players taking actions just like any other uncertain outcome. However, if a Kid fails any action while resolving a challenge, the Wilder may DISPOSE of the kid. 

When a Kid is disposed of The Wilder and any Doompas describe what that looks like. The Doompas sing a little song about it. Then the player whose kid was just disposed of takes a Doompa Token from the Wilder and  now plays the rest of the game AS A DOOMPA BLOOMPA.

### Playing as a Doompa
As a Doompa Bloompa you get to tip the scales of any action. Individually you can't do much, but once there are a couple of you things can get pretty interesting... Playing as a doompa has some specific rules:
- The only words you can say to other characters are variations of "Doompa, lumpa, oomps bloompa" etc.
- You can narrate nonverbal actions.
- You may sing actual words to each other during your Doompa song
- But other than that NO TALKING.
- During any action you may use your Doompa token to give +1 to either the Kid resolving the action or the Wilder.
- Doompas are very definite by nature and as such they NEVER initiate any actions. However, they are an ever present force in the factory and may therefore contribute their influence to any uncertain outcome.

## Gameplay
 First roleplay an opening scene- there is great pageantry arriving at the candy factory. How do you all arrive? How does the Wilder introduce the factory?
 
 Then enter the factory and the magical elevator. In the Magical Elevator the Kids always decide which floor to go to next.
 
 Flip over the corresponding card and then head to that location. You may not return to any previous locations once you have left.
 
 The Wilder establishes the location, reveals any challenges and the waits for the Kids to act.

Over the course of the game Kids will be "Disposed of" until there is only one left. At that time, or if you have been to every other floor (or really if it just makes sense in the story) head to the final floor, the Wilders office.
There is no challenge in the Wilders office, but anything can happen there... at this point, the remaining Kids and the Wilder should try to complete their objectives and the Doompa Bloompas should do whatever they know in their doompa hearts to be true.

Whoever owns the Magical Candy Factory at the end of the scene decides how the story ends.
