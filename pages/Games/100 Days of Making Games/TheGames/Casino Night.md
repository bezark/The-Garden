Casino Night is a casino themed mega-game. It is to be played in a space with multiple tables and multiple rooms and can be played by any number of players

There should be tables = the number of casino patrons/4
There should be enough 'Chips' for every player to have at least 40 and for the house to have double that amount.

Each table has a dealer who can run different casino games

Upon arriving at the casino guests are awarded anywhere between 20-50 chips depending on their attire by the bouncer.

Guests may go to any table with these chips and spend them freely in order to earn more chips.

## Bar
There is a bar where guests can purchase beverages with chips. 
The bartender can ask for chip tips and the bartender may recruit any player to take their place. In order to be the bartender you simply serve drinks for chips at the agreed upon price. All the earned chips go back to The House. The bartender may keep any tipped chips.

## Tables
The different games run at each table may consit of any classic casino games including:
- Texas Holdem
- Mahjong
- Black Jack
- Backgammon

And Guess the Card. Guess the card is a game where one card is dealt out face down on the table and the players can compete amongst themselves or against the house to guess the value of the card. The house wil be cheating. If the players can correctly deduce how the house is cheating, the house will give the 40 chips to keep their mouth shut and then cancel the game.

## The Bouncer
The bouncer welcomes guests to the casino and gives them their starting chips. They also say something elusive like "There's more to this casino than meets the eye" or, "Do you wanna meet the house?", "The house can answer any question for a price..." etc.

If a player or group of players approaches them with 70 chips they will take them to a secret location and perform a secret tarot reading where they can ask the house any question.

The tarot reading ought to feel authentic and genuinely weird. Using an oracle deck, the bouncer (or dedicated Oracle) lays out a 3 card spread and interpet the cards to suit their answers. The tarot reading should be in a dimly lit space.

## Digital and Physical
Casino Night is a game that can be played in both physical and digital space- for digital games players may use the following rooms:

- [Texas Holdem/Gambling with the House](https://playingcards.io/4tujsy)
- [Backgamon](https://playingcards.io/tawhy2)
- [Freeplay](https://playingcards.io/5wxxkk)

The bouncer should attend to both physical and digital guests, and the tarot readings should also be accesible via private zoom.

Remote players have an account- when they arrive they get funds added to [this account](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11tmt83DvbfkAPuwWldD3XAZQb8acuE_usiV9-s9haXg/edit?usp=sharing). When they play games with remote chips, they withdraw them from this account- the virtual dealr simply subtracts their desired chips from the spreadsheet and gives them appropriate chips in the virtual game. When they cash out the funds get added back to their account
