An evolution of [[The World is Ending]] after [[The World Is Ending Playtest]]

*The World is Ending* is a [[ttrpg]] about [[Futures]], the [[Apocalypse]], [[What is the world and how would it end]], [[Fearing the End of the World]] and trying to push past this abysmal fact that [[It is easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism]] It is inspired heavily by [[Legacy Life Among the Ruins]].

Object of the game: Work together to End the World and in so doing, envision an equitable, pluralistic future that is ecologically oriented, cultivates imaginations and produces a healthy environment for all. Who said the end of the world had to be so bad after all?

# Materials
A shared white board, either physical or digital.

# Setup 
*The World is Ending* is a game about shifting frames and changing paradigms. In order to simulate the End of the World, first we have to simulate the world. It is the view of this game that the 'World' simply constitutes the totality of the [[Systems]] a group of individuals interacts with at any given moment. There is no scientific backing for that definition- it could be wrong.

Suffice it to say, that a rough articulations of major systems of our World could also serve as a rough articulation of that world.


## Determine the Scope of Your World
Decide as a group what scope you want your game to have- will you be playing as a county, the whole world, a city, or a small town. You can play at whatever scale you want, just all come to agreement as to how far 'zoomed in' or 'zoomed out' you want to be while playing the game.

Next decided on the tone of the game- how do you want to change your world? Through realistic ends?

To set up, each player writes 2-3 systems onto the shared board. If you are playing this game in the United States in the 21st Century, for example, it might behoove you to write 'Systemic Racism', 'Capitalism', 'Democracy', 'Ecological Destruction' among many other possibilities. There are no wrong answers here, and there are no value judgments placed on these systems. Just try to accurately articulate the systems that make up your present world.

Count up the total number of systems you have written, add two to it and write that number down. This is the "Size of the World". For example, if you articulated 8 systems at start of the game, the Size of the World would be 10.

Then, as a group, draw connections linking these systems together via their inter-dependencies. If you wrote 'Capitalism' on one card and 'Consumerism' on another, for instance, you could connect those two cards since they are interdependent. If a dependency only goes one way, you may draw an arrow.

Draw arrows from the system that gives power to the object that is dependent  on that power. For instance if B depends on A, write A -> B. If they are dependent on each other write A <--> B.

%%After you have sufficiently populated and connected your word, go a head and add power tokens to each note per the number of connections it has.

In the above picture, Capitalism has 5 circles on it because it is connected to five other systems.

Finally create a section of the board that will function as your timeline.

# Gameplay
*The World is Ending* is a game of shared story telling. Players take turns going around in a circle and describing the events that led the current world to End and a new world to emerge in it's place. Each turn consists of a Sentence Spoken and an Action Taken.

## The Sentence Spoken
On your turn you may say one sentence that describes major events that happen in the "World" that change the state of that World. Each sentence should say the year that the events take place, should build off of what has previously been established, and should support your action on the board. This means you sentence should either describe a system gaining power, loosing power or something new emerging. The game moves forward in time, so each year should follow after each other.

Possible sentences could be:
- *In 2023 major climate events catastrophically damage federal infrastructure*
- *In 2027 Gen C disavows US Currency and starts supporting themselves on solar blockchain bartering*
- *In 2031 Scientists realize they had physics all wrong*

There are no wrong answers, so long as you are true to yourself, true to your world, whatever that may be, and true to the story already being told at the table.

A player who is not the speaker should add the sentence to the timeline.

## The Action Taken
With each sentence spoken and Action is taken. This action may either be to Shift Power or Imagine Alternatives

### Shifting Power
When Shifting Power, you may use your Sentence Spoken to either add, remove, or change an arrow connected to an existing system on the board depending on whether that sentence strengthens or weakens that system. For example, if I say "In 2035 massive cyber attacks cripple Financial systems which sows distrust in Capitalism", I could perhaps remove an arrow connecting Capitalism and Financial Systems, or perhaps remove and arrow connecting Capitalism and Big Tech, or perhaps I would add a token to Cryptocurrencies. Whatever you think feels truthful. You may even shift an arrow from one system to another system, but you may never add or remove more than one arrow at once. Accordingly, don't let your Sentence Spoken outpace the progress on the board- you can't say "In 2022 Capitalism Implodes" if it still has many connections.

If, however, the final arrow is removed from a system, remove that system from the board. Add a special symbol on the time line, and go around the table and answer the question "Where were you when \_\_\_ Ended?" Each player may answer as themselves, a character, a city, or something nonhuman. Whatever feels true.

### Imagining Alternatives
Conversely, you may also use your sentence spoken to Imagine Alternatives- when you do this you may create a new system and add it to the board. These alternatives can be anything- feel free to let your imagination run wild. For example you could say, 'In 2050 Quantum Computing allows for Collective Consciousness' and add a Collective Consciousness system onto the board. You must, however, be able to connect it to at least one existing system on the board. Be sure connect any newly created  inter-dependencies. 

Feel free to also use the Imagining alternatives deck

# End of the Game
This game does not have an end, because it is the view of this game that the World does not have an End. It simply hurtles forward, constantly changing and remaking itself with the passage of time. Additionally, envisioning an equitable, pluralistic future that is ecologically oriented, cultivates imaginations and produces a healthy environment for all, is not a finite act. It is a way of being that require continual commitment, curiosity and compassion.

That being said, there is only so much that one group of people can do in a given day, and so when you have played enough for the day, you may pause the game. Keep all the materials, though and play again when ready.
