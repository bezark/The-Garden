For the Global Game Jam I teamed up with Ami Dave and Benny to make a video game. I was tasked with the puzzle design and it was my first real foray into a digital game process. 

Our first step was to brainstorm on a miro board

I made a playable paper prototype on Mro which really helped us step through the entire game. I was even able to simulate different rooms appearing by revealing hidden frames!

Then I made an "Action Script" which I don't know if that's a thing or not..
I basically tried to make something very programmatic to really help a developer step through all the internal logic of the game.
I chose to build that in Roam Research, but I have no idea if that was the best platform or not.

Feel free to check it out:

And Stay tuned! I will publish the finished game here when It's finished being developed.
