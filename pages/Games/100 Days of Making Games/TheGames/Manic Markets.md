- Get a BUNCH of tokens of 4 colors specifically:
	- 2 tokens of EACH color PER PLAYER + an additional 4 tokens of each color.

- Each player randomly draws 5 cubes.
- Place the remaining cubes in the center. This is the Market.

## On your turn
On your turn you may **make a trade**, **change the rules**, **shuffle your hand** or **win the game!**.

### Make a trade
If you make a trade you may exchange any cubes you have with any of the cubes in the market as per the ruels listed on the market place. You may engage in any number of trades of the same type on the same turn. The ? space means a cube of your choice.

### Change the rules
Pay the price listed to the market and change the number of rules allowed. Do so by swapping 1 or 3 cubes on the marketplace page with cubes of your choice from the market.

### Shuffle your hand
Toss in your hand to the market and draw out a random hand of one fewer cubes. If you only have 1 cube, you may draw 1 random cube

### Win the game
If you have the 5 cubes listed for winning the game, you WIN the game! Now the question is, what was the game in the first place? And why were you playing it????
