This game never got finished but here is a playable first pass:

[[Coal Mine.html]]

Currently you can buy and sell coal at different prices, hire workers, work a couple of years, kill some workers, replace them, etc.

It is NOT accurate in the slightest and I found the prospect of really taking the time to flesh it out daunting, but it's a project I'd like to return to.

# Original Brainstorming
This is a [[Twine]] [[game]] that is emerging from [[Game 38 Brainstorm]] and is connected to my [[History of Energy Research Project]]

Part of the struggle with it so far is I don't have a clear plan for implementing it in twine yet. So Here is what I'm thinking:

## Logic:
- Day at work 
	- Either Normal, Accident, or Event
		- Normal leads to Normal passages
		- Accidents lead to accident passages
		- Accidents become more likely as the mine gets deeper and the more workers you have
		- That math would be:
			- for workers(Random number (100)< depth) accident
	- Each 

## The arc is:
- open a mine
- business is slow
- business grows
- workers grow
- accidnets
- water???
- a pump!
- Deeper! More money!
- coke
- A better pump
- More people
- Steam engines, the future
- The earth
