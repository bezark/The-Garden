Randomly determine 1st player. 
The first players 1st move is to place a 7th piece on an adjacent empty space. Otherwise, follow gameplay instructions below.

## Gameplay
On your turn you may move one piece. 
Depending on which space your piece is in, it can do one of two possible things.

### Dark spaces
If the piece you're moving starts it's turn in a dark space it may move to one adjacent space. An adjacent space is any circle connected to the current space by a line.

If there is a piece of the opposing team in that space you may 'attack' it and remove it from the board.

### Light Spaces
If you are in a light space, you may move your piece two spaces. Each space must be empty for your to do so.

### End of turn
If your piece ends it's turn in the opposing players goal, remove it from the board and add it to your score.

### End of game
When there are no pieces left on the board count up your points. The player with the highest score wins.
