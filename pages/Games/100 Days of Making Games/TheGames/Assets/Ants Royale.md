# Gameplay
On a turn players:
- Play card combinations or Discard Cards
- Draw up to back up to 5 Cards
- Use abilities

## Playing Card Combinations
Players may play card combinations that match the suites of spaces they are connected to. In the picture above, the blue player may play a heart and a club while the pink player may play a spade and a club. All cards played must be in a connected sequence of links. You may play anywhere between 2 and five cards and doing so grants you the following during the Moves Phase of your turn:

| Cards Played | Abilities Earned                                                                       |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2 Cards      | Add 1 piece                                                                            |
| 3 Cards      | Add 2 Pieces or Draw 2 additional cards or remove 1 piece of your oponent              |
| 4 Cards      | Remove 2 pieces of your opponent or replace one oponents piece with a piece of your own |
| 5 Cards      | Replace two opponent pieces with your pieces or add 3 pieces to the board                                                                              |

You may play as many combinations as you like, but you may only count each space you're connected to once- your combinations on the board must be fully connected and without repetition. When you play cards put them into discard piles of each suite so players can track which suite has been played more frequently

Instead of drawing cards you may choose to discard any number of cards from your hand and draw that many from the deck

## Drawing up to 5
After you play card combinations redraw up to 5 cards in your hand. If there aren't enough cards in the deck shuffle the discard piles into a new deck.

## Use Abilities
After drawing your cards, then use any abilities just gained this turn. If your card combination gives you a choce of abilities you may choose at this time. When placing new pieces on the board, they must be placed on links that are empty and adjacent to pieces you control.
If your ability let you draw cards draw these in adition to the cards you already drew.

In addition to these abailities you may also choose to remove either 1 or 3 pieces from the board.
Removing one piece makes your oponent discard one random card from their hand. Removing 3 pieces make your oponent discard their entire hand and draw a new one.

# Game End
The game ends when there is only one color left on the board.
