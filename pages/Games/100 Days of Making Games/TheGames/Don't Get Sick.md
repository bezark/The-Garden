Wow this was rediculously hard. There are sooooo many things that are ~not finished~ about this game. Picking a serious topic was a BIG mistake in starting a new habit because it really creates a hang up in designing.That's why this is NOT a game about [[COVID]] but is about BRO-VID.  I realize that I picked an INCREDIBLY complicated place to start and I REALLLLLLY want to scale back and start a little bit more simply tomorrow. I cAnT put soooo Muccchhh effffooortt into this. But it's a game. Its a start. I am proud! 2/100 [[itp100days]] [[NYUdaily]]
