*Six by Six Township* is a game about building a town on a 6x6 grid just like the [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] proclaimed! 

It is also an evolution of [[Build a Town]], [[Race to Build a Town]] and [[On the Map]].

**Object of the Game:** Be the first player to build a Train station and connect your town to the outside world.

# Setup 
Each player takes a palyer board, builds a house and plows a field.

Take all the remaining tiles and sort them by type, placing them all in the New Commers area
# Gameplay
Turns go back and forth in rounds- Each turn consists of 1 action each round consists of 3 turns. At the end of each round remove all the buildings in the "Auctioning" area from the game. Then rotate change starting player.
## Start of a turn

On your turn you may first take any actions that your built buildings permit. 

Then you may take one Primary action:
- Plow a Field
- Enter Auction
- Construct Buildings
## Building actions
Some buildings let you take additional actions. The Farm, forinstance, lets you plow a field. Take any actions permitted by your buildings before taking your primary action.
## Primary Action
After taking any building actions, take one primary action:
### Plow a field
As an action you may always play a plowed field in an empty space.
### Enter Auction
Take a tile from the new commers area and move it to the "Auctioning" Area. The buildings in the auctioning area the only ones that can be built. They may be built by any player and will be removed from the game at the end of the round if they are not built
### Construct Buildings
You may construct any buildings in the aution so long as you can meet any spatial requirements on the back of the card as well as paying any costs.

**Costs**
Building costs come from the total value produced by other built buildings. Built buildings produce resources that can be used to build other buildings. This value is in the top right hand corner of the card and  does not accumulate. For instance, a sawmill produces 1 wood. If your town has 2 sawmills in it, your town produces 2 wood and can build buildings requiring 2 wood (such as a kiln)in it, your town produces 2 wood and can build buildings requiring 2 wood (such as a kiln).

**Building Resources:**
There are several resources buildings can produce:
- Wood (Brown)
- Bricks (Red)
- Money (green)
- Prestige (yellow)
  
  These all function similarly: each building produces them and they may be used to build more buildings.
  
  Some buildings produce additional resources depending on placement. The store, for instance, produces an additional prestige if it is adjacent to 2 commercial buildings. The Sawmill produces an additional wood if it is adjacent to or on top of a river.
  
  **Spatial Requirements**
  Buildings often also have spatial requirements. These are represented by lines connecting to symbols of other buildings. This means that the building must be orthagonally adjacent to those types of spaces in order to be built. For instance, a House card must be orthagonally adjacent to a plowed field.
  
  If there a building symbol but not a line, this means you must simple have that building in your town. The church, for instance, must have 4 houses anywhere in town.
  
  A blue dot represents a 'commercial building'. There are several buildings with blue dots on them and they all count as commercial buildings. If a card lists a blue dot as a spatial requirement, It simply requires any commercial building.
### The Train Station
Building the train station is similar to building any other building, it simply requires 2 spaces, must be adjacent to 3 commercial buildings and must be built in a town with at least 3 prestige. The first person to build the train station wins the game.
## End of the round
After each player has taken 3 turns the round ends. Remove any unbuilt buildings from the auctioning area from the game. If the Train Station was unbilt, return it to the 'New Comers' area instead. Then rotate first player to the left and begin a new round.
