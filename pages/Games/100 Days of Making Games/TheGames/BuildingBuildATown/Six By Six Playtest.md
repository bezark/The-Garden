# Notes
Back and forth was weird. Sort of strategic but also frusterating
tleegraph office was broke- should actually only be once per round, not every turn.

Impossible for store to get points!!!!
In order to get to $10 dollars, your hotels need to connect to 1 store, but that's not possible so you wind up doing 12 regardelss.

Hard to keep track of who is doing what action

10 points seemed pretty high
