I got stuck. I tried to revise [[Six by Six Township]] again but I couldn't- why not?

- The process became too dense. This game is actually very intersting but my need to produce output in a timely manner makes it really hard for me to iterate on this. I am having a hard time articulating what I need to change and how I want to work. I feel embarassed at saying I was going to make a new game but I am just sort of in weeds some how.....

I think I also am coming up against the feeling like I am not doing enough. I appear to have stalled out at 33 games (a cursed number.)

Is this motion or action?
What is this barrier? I can try again to write rules for this thing, but I think what is hard is that I am just sort of writing things without knowing what they are. I am fabricating rules for cards and boards that don't exist.

Let me try again? I don't know..... FUCK. I feel really stuck.

Like it or not I am here again at the bottom of the valley. In that stupid part of the graph again.

So what do I need to let go of? 
What do I need to 'figure out???'

I want to hit something. Break something. Let all of this go. I want to be done with this stupid exercise. I hate the fact that the only thing making me make games is this dumb performative action of articulating publicly.

But also, it's making me make games I guess.

Why does it matter? Why do I need to output something new everyday?

Why do i have to make new things?
I am very frusterated with today.


I want to continue working on this game but I think I need a little bit of space. I have 14 days left and if I return to my original clip of a game every 2 days I should be able to hit 40 games. Not that that matters, but I guess it does? I guess this indicates that I have lost sight of my path a little bit.... I have had this tension for the entire time of trying to produce some sort of tangible result, some sort of thing I can hold up and say 'look this is real'. I realize that's the capitalism in me tlaking, but also, well, that's the capitalism in me talking! That's a real part of me.

I guess I have 2 roads. Or 3.
Road 1: Ditch [[Building Build a Town]] and just make a bunch of new games, bad ones, but do it to say I did and get to '40'
Road 2: Keep going with [[Building Build a Town]] and be OK with not 'finishing' on day 100. Be OK with not having 40 games.

Road 3: Mix it up. Come back to this. Or not. Do something new tomorrow. or not. Forget roads. Don't get anywhere, just be where you are. Just show up tomorrow.
