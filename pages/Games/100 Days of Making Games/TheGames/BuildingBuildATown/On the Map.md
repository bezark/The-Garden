On the map is a town building game. The object of the game is to build the first town worth 20 points.

You are a farmer/pioneer/mayor building a town in a conviently available plot of land with respelndent natural resources.

Use this [[On The Map Cards.pdf|Buildings Deck]]

# Setup
Each player takes a palyer board, builds a house, plows a field and places themselves in on spot on the board. 
They fill the rest of the board up with 2 trees

Shuffle the townsfolk deck and reveal three above the board. These are newcommers.

Each player takes a player card

# Gameplay
Turns go back and forth.

On your turn you:
- Build New Buildings
- Take actions
- Supply or remove villagers
- Check for Victory

## Build New Buildings
You may build any of the current new comers into your village if you can pay their cost and meet their current space requirements. Each building has different costs and needs. Farms, for instance need a space with 1 house built in it, while logging need a space with trees.

When building, pay any immediate costs, then take the building and place them near your board. ~~Score any points on their card~~. Then reveal a new card from the deck and place it in the newcomers spot.

If you do not build, you may optionally diascard a current newcommer and replace it with a building from the top of the deck.
 
## Taking Actions
Then take your actions. Your character may either:
- Remove one tree from the board, turning it into wood
- Harvest 2 food from your field
- Build a house with 2 wood

Your character may only ever do one action in a turn

Then take actions for each of your current villagers. Your villager may have multiple possible actions, but each vilager may only take one per turn.

## Supply or Remove
Then pay the cost each villager has at the bottom of their card. This cost must be paid every turn. If you cannot pay their cost/meet their ongoing need, remove them from the board.

## Check For Victory
At this point, if you have 20 or more points, you win the game.
