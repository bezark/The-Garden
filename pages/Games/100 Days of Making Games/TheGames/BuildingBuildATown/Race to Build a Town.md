## Seasons
After each player has taken a turn, advance the season tracker by one season. In your journal, write one sentence that best describes this season

In Winter, any player who does not own or share a house (a house can hold up to two players) looses one health.

At the end of winter each player must eat 4 food or loose one health per food not eaten.

Then discard any uneaten or unused seeds unless your town has a store house. 

Then add 1 tree to each forest space that has 1 or 2 trees in it and is not orthagonally adjacent to any building or plowed field.

Shuffle the discraded forraging cards back into the forraging deck, move the season tracker back to spring and begin a new year.
