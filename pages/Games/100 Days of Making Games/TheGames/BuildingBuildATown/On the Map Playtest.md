Start with three food 
first player starts with two
a little crunchy
looging symbol weird
you chopping weird
maybe only pay for actions you use
dominion logic (STACK)
Doesn't want to hel the oponent
taking logging didn't make sense
locked in start
maybe mark field and farm?
plowed field needs an x
are farmers god  mode?
maybe you don't need to get food all the time?

you're in your own head
logging he only way to win becvause you need to clear

All logging

MOrei variety in setup- 
farms need a plowed field instead of cleare land
movin g logger was boring

2 farm store gate a little confusing

destroy buildings
disconnect between stars and money
train station increases movement
the store is broken!!!


ypou got like way too much money 

a lot of work to build a farm
why is money a thing?
train station toop hard and not enough
food was a little bit of a transaction
