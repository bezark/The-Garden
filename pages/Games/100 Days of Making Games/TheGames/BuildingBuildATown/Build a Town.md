## Seasons
After each player has taken a turn, advance the season tracker by one season. Each Player must eat 1 food or loose 1 health. In Winter, any player who does not own or share a house (a house can hold up to two players) looses one health.
At the end of winter, discard any uneaten or unused seeds unless you have a store house. Then advance the year tracker by one. If you have not built town hall by the end of the fifth year, you loose!
