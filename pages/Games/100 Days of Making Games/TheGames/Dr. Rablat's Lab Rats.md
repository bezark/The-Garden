*A two player cooperative game of mousey miscommunication.  
Can you get the cheese without gettin the squeeze???*

The infamous Dr. RaBlat is conducting communication experiments on 2 lab rats (that’s you!) The Doctor believes that rats can actually communicate if under enough pressure. Oh boy! Get through all the challenges and you’ll be rewarded with a juicy piece o’ CHEESE! But fail any one challenge 3 times and you’re CAT FOOD. Yikes!!!

## Gameplay
In each challenge, 1 rat plays as the squeaker, the other as the scribe.
The Squeaker will be assigned a message they need to communicate. The Scribe will try to decipher that message. The squeaker only has 20 seconds to communicate the message before their video feed cuts out. You can only communicate through using gestures because, you know, you're rats. 

If you get get the message correct, you'll advance to the next round. If you don't you'll have to do the current round over again.

Either way you'll switch roles.

Good luck!
Note: the game only works if two different people use the website so make sure to grab a friend!
