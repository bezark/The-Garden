_Your village is in crisis. The dragon must be stopped._

**The object of the game is to defeat the dragon in the desert.**

## You Will need:
- Ace-Six of Diamonds
- Ace-Eight of Clubs
- A piece of paper and something to write with
- 8 thirst tokens
- 12 strength tokens
- A You token
- an 8 sided dice
- The Lookup Tables (Below)
## Setup:
- Shuffle the clubs cards (Desert Cards) into one pile and the diamonds (Rewards) into another
- Draw a tiny village on the paper and place a you token there. This paper is now the map.
- This is where you are in the desert.
## On your turn:
- You can either return to a places you've already discovered or you can explore somewhere new.
-
### To explore somewhere new:
- Draw a path from where you are to somewhere new on the map.
- Flip over the top card of the Desert deck and add a little drawing of that place at the end of the path.
- Move yourself to that space
- **If you want to,** resolve the challenge in that space.
- At the end of every turn, regardless if you moved or not, gain a thirst token. If you get 8 thirst tokens you DIE OF THIRST. SO THIRSTY.
### To return places you've already been
- Instead of exploring somewhere new you may return to places you've already been. Move along the roads up to two spaces away.
- You can also return to any encounter that is still available.
- at the end of any day discard a water.
- To resolve an encounter, roll the d8
	- if you roll a number that is greater than your thirst, you succeed.
		- Reap the benefit and then discard the card.
	- Otherwise, leave the card in your locations
### Resolving Challenges
- Roll the 8 sided dice. Subtract your thirst, add your strength. This number is the result.
- If the result equals or surpasses the challenge you overcome the challenge.
- If you overcome the challenge draw a reward card and discard the location.
- Otherwise, leave the challenge faceup on the table. You may try again on your next turn.
- **The Dragon**
	- Battling the dragon works just like any other challenge, but if you only get one shot. If you win, you win, if you lose, YOU LOSE.
