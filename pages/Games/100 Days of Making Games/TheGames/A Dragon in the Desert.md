_Your village is in crisis. The dragon must be stopped._

**The object of the game is to defeat the dragon in the desert.**

## You Will need:

-   Ace-Six of Diamonds
-   Ace-Eight of Clubs
-   A piece of paper and something to write with
-   8 thirst tokens
-   12 strength tokens
-   A You token
-   an 8 sided dice
-   The Lookup Tables (Below)

## Setup:

-   Shuffle the clubs cards (Desert Cards) into one pile and the diamonds (Rewards) into another
-   Draw a tiny village on the paper and place a you token there. This paper is now the map.
-   This is where you are in the desert.

## On your turn:
-   You can either return to a places you've already discovered or you can explore somewhere new.
-   
### To explore somewhere new:
-   Draw a path from where you are to somewhere new on the map.
-   Flip over the top card of the Desert deck and add a little drawing of that place at the end of the path.
-   Move yourself to that space
-   **If you want to,** resolve the challenge in that space.
-   At the end of every turn, regardless if you moved or not, gain a thirst token. If you get 8 thirst tokens you DIE OF THIRST. SO THIRSTY.

### To return places you've already been
-   Instead of exploring somewhere new you may return to places you've already been. Move along the roads up to two spaces away.
-   You can also return to any encounter that is still available.
-   at the end of any day discard a water.
-   To resolve an encounter, roll the d8
	-   if you roll a number that is greater than your thirst, you succeed.
		-   Reap the benefit and then discard the card.
	-   Otherwise, leave the card in your locations
        
### Resolving Challenges
-   Roll the 8 sided dice. Subtract your thirst, add your strength. This number is the result.
-   If the result equals or surpasses the challenge you overcome the challenge.
-   If you overcome the challenge draw a reward card and discard the location.
-   Otherwise, leave the challenge faceup on the table. You may try again on your next turn.
-   **The Dragon**
	-   Battling the dragon works just like any other challenge, but if you only get one shot. If you win, you win, if you lose, YOU LOSE.
