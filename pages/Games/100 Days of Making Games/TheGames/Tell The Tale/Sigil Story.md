*A journal based TTRPG for 1 player*

You'll need: 
- Ace-7 of one suit from a deck of cards
- A piece of paper
- Something to write with

# Setup

- Take a piece of paper and fold it so that it has 8 squares.
- Then set aside the ace- this is The Home. Start here. Read the home and answer the questions however you like. Write your answers down on the sheet of paper in the top left square.
- 
*Every Story has a context. A world that it exists in. Define that context for your self. Pick a genre and world you can define in a couple of words.*

- Then Shuffle the remaining 6 cards. draw one. 

# Gameplay
- Lookup the corresponding card and write the name of the matching sigil in the next square. Then read the prompt and answer the questions in writing. Try to keep your answers constrained to the squares.
- When you're done with the current card, draw the next card and repeat the process. Try to build off of what you've already written and advance the story.
- When you've completed all 7 cards, choose one sigil to return to to complete your story. Perhaps you left something undone. Or perhaps you want to randomly select one.
- However you choose, respond to the prompt in writing and conclude your story.

| Ace  |  The Home  | You Begin in your home. The place you know. The way you are.  Who are you? Where are you? What is comfortable about this space an time?                                                                       |
