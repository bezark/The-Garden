*A Story is nothing more than a deliberately arranged sequence of events. The Tale itself matters not, it's the telling of the tale that gives it life.*

Welcome to *Tell the Tale*, a journal based role playing game for one.
In tell the tale YOU will tell your own tale and craft your own adventure from a significant symbols and potent prompts. You can tell whatever sort of story you like so long as you care enough to tell it.

# To play the game you will need:
- 1 viewmaster
- 2 Signature Tell the Tale Story Sigil Disks
- The patented Tell the Tale adventure journal
- A pen (for adventures are NEVER written in pencil)
- 7 Days
- Your Imagination

# Setup
- Place the Act 1 Adventure Disc into the viewmaster and set the frame to the starting image (THE HOME).
- Open the Journal to a New Adventure Page and begin writing your next story



# Telling Your Tale
Tell the Tale is to be played over seven days and it is best broken up into 2 sessions a day- once in the morning and once in the evening.

In your first session gaze into the viewmaster and look upon the Story Sigil of The Home. When your eyes are thoroughly sated and your imagination inspired, turn to the first page of your Adventure Journal and begin writing!

## The Fork in the Road

Welcome back storyteller. 
By now you should have completed your first session responding to The Home Story Sigil.
Now, however, you have a very important decision to make: which path will be yours? Be careful, for once made, this choice can not be unmade. There are no 'backsies' in the hands of fate. Which Path would you like to go down:
- The Path of the Adventurer
- The Path of the Wanderer 
- The Path of the Student 
- The Path of the Leader
- The Path of the Exile
- or The Path of the Healer?

If you chose the Adventurer, click your viewmaster ahead one frame. If you chose the wanderer click twice. Student- 3 clicks, Leader 4 clicks, Exile 5 clicks, Healer 6 clicks. 

For your second session, look into the viewmaster at the new image and use the Story Sigil Lookup Table to find the prompt that corresponds to the Sigil you have landed on.

**VERY IMPORTANT: FROM HERE ON OUT you are ON YOUR PATH and you must ALWAYS advance your viewfinder by the number that corresponds to your path**. If you chose the path of the wanderer for instance- you must ALWAYS advance your viewer by 2 clicks before every session. If you're on the path of the healer, you must advance by 6 clicks every session. Make sure to remember this number and be very careful to not to miscount! If you do this correctly you will advance through the disk without any repeated images- if you come across a repeated image before the 4th day, you probably miscounted.

(If you messed up, don't sweat it too much. Just advance the viewfinder one by one until you find an image you haven't encountered yet and respond to that one.)

Now that you are on your path work your way Through the Act I Disk. When you are finished with Act I (aka when you have written about all 7 images exactly once change the disk to Act II

Begin Act II with The Maze and then work your way through Act II in the same manner you did Act I. Be sure to stay upon your path!
%%Should we give them a chance to change paths here?%%


On the final day of your journey complete the last journal prompt and conclude your tale!

# Story Sigil Lookup Table
## Act I
- **The Home:** You Begin in your home. The place you know. The way you are.  Who are you? Where are you? What is comfortable about this space an time?
- **The Shock:** Something sharply ruptures what you know. What can you see now that you can't un-see? What is the shocking truth and how are you part of the problem?
- **The Path:** For better or worse you begin upon the path. Do you feel ready? Where do you hope it will take you? What must you leave behind?
- **The Wise:** You find the one who you think holds the answers that you seek. Do you ask the right questions? How do they reply? Are they as wise as you thought they were?
- **The Vision:** Something from another world enters your mind- a dream, a sight a sound or more. Is it a truth or is it a lie? Does it show you the way or warn of dangers to come?
- **The Ceremony:** A time has arrived to mark an important occasion. What is it? Are you the subject, the officiant or a spectator? How does this important performance change your life?
- **The Edge:** You arrive at the end of what you know. What do you think lies beyond? Do you cross the threshold or are you not yet ready?

## Act II
- **The Maze:** A labyrinth! One would easily get lost here and many have. Is it a physical or mental? Do you find your way through it or succumb to it's twists and turns? What do you find and how do you  escape?
- **The Many:** Community- a group of people. Peers, strangers, foes or something else. Who are they? What do they want? Do you join or must you stand apart?
- **The Shadow:** Your shadow - your opposite, your enemy your secret self. Who are they? What do they want? What do you do?
- **The Trial:** The time has come to test yourself. There is a challenge that must be met- what is it? Are you prepared? Do you prevail?
- **The Center:** You find the Center- the middle. The secret truth, the root of the problem, the heart of it ALL. How do you respond? Do you rise to the moment or break under pressure? 
- **The Storm:** Chaos. Destruction. Uncertainty. It's all been unleashed. Did you unleash or was it unleashed upon you? Do you hold fast or are you swept out to sea? When the clouds break, What was lost and who remains?
- **The Return:** You return home, for better or worse. Is it the same or has it changed? How do you feel being back? Have you found something rank that's festered in your absence or is there something cherished that needs preserving? And will you stay here, or is there more you need to do?
