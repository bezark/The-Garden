A game for 5+ players

This game is probably best played with 8 people??

You will need cards that say the following:
- 2 cards that say "President"
- 2 cards that say "Prime Minister"
- 2 cards that say "General"
- 2 cards that say "Secretary" 
- 1 card that says "Make laws"
- 1 card that says  "Arrest"
- 1 card that says "Appoint".
- 1 card that says "Interrogate"

A Board with the following two areas:
	- Elected
	- Appointed

2 sets of Party affiliation cards equal to the number of players divided by 2. *These can be just regular old playing cards- if you're playing an 8 player game get 4 spades and 4 hearts etc. *

**Make sure to include the ace of whichever suites you're using**

# Setup
Shuffle and deal out the party affiliation cards to everyone. These are secret.  Whoever gets the ace of each suite is the respective secret party leader.
Then place cards on the board in the following configuration:

Then hold an election! Everyone who does not have a role at the beginning of each round votes on all the elected officials. Determine who is the President and who is the prime minister.

The President then appoints a player to be a General and another player to be Secretary 

Hand out the corresponding role cards to all officials.

# Gameplay
## Object of the game
The object of the game is simple: each party has a secret party leader. In order to win one party simply needs to arrest the other party leader.

## Playing a Round
At the start of a round, elect all electable positions. The power to elect is always held by the people and the people are any players who do not currently have a role. Then appoint any appointable officials. At the start of the game this ability is held by the president but that may change.

Then pass legislation!

## Passing legislation
Whoever has the ability to Make Laws (the Prime Minister at the start of the game) may move 1 card on the board each round. This may be moving an ability card (Making Laws, Make Arrests, Interrogate, Make appointments ) to another role or moving a role (and any attached abilities) to either "elected" or "appointed" positions.

Abide by these rules going forward.

## Interrogation and Arrests
Whoever has the ability to Interrogate may look at any players party affiliation card. They are the only player who may see this card

Whoever has the ability to make arrests may at any point during the round arrest any other player. This player immediately loses any role card they had and are sent to jail. If the arrested player is a party leader the game ends and the other party wins. DON'T CHEAT!


## End of the round and Revolts
At the end of every round remove al players from jail and elect all electable positions. For each position, anyone who wishes to run for office may announce their candidacy and make a case for themselves. You may divulge your party affiliation if you like, but that might also be a bad idea. The people then vote and determine a winner.
In the event of a tied election, randomly determine the winner from the tied parties. Again, the People consit of any players currently out of office.

If three rounds pass without holding any elections a revolt happens and the people may immediately jail up to 3 players and redistribute their roles among themselves.
