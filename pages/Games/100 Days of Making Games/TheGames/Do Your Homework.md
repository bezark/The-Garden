*A game of mischief and worksheets for 4+ players*

This game is being developed for a confluence of different projects: both my [[RTSS Final Project - Prototype of Virtual Field Trips]] and [[DFM Project]]. The game is designed to develop and test the [[Ideal Virtual Field Trip Teacher Controls|Teacher Controls]] for a [[Virtual Field Trips]] a game setting.

There are several roles in this game:
- Teacher
- Students
- Trouble Makers

There should always be 1 Teacher and at least one trouble maker. Add 1 troublemaker for after every 7 students. For example, In a 10 player game there should be:
- 1 Teacher
- 2 Trouble Makers
- 7 Students

%%In a 13 player game you would have:
- 1 Teacher,
- 3 Trouble Makers
- 9 Students%%

#  Playing the game in Meat-Space
## You will need
- 1 room for detention
- A classroom for every three students + trouble makers rounded down
	*IE in a game with 6 Students and 1 Trouble Maker you will need 3 classrooms.
	In a game with 10 students and 2 Trouble Makers, you will need 4 classrooms*
 
- Phones for each player

## Setup
Designate one room as detention. Publicly determine the teacher and secretly determine the troublemakers. Everyone should know who the teacher is, no one should know who the trouble makers are.

## Object of the game:
Teachers: Make sure a majority of the class finishes their homework.
Trouble Makers: turn the whole class into trouble makers!
Students: Finish your homework 

## Game Play:
Everyone runs around to different rooms trying to finish their homework. For students to complete their assignments, they must spend 1 full minute in a room without being interrupted by a trouble maker. If they do, they have finished their assignment in that room and they may move to another room of their choice.
If they finish their home work in all three rooms they become teachers pets and may not be turned into trouble makers.

Trouble maker- if a trouble maker spends 30 seconds in a room with a student, that student becomes a trouble maker too. Once you're a trouble maker, your goal is too turn other students into trouble makers too.
trouble makers can whisper to each other (communicate directly via text or phone call etc.)

If a student or teacher's pet thinks there is a trouble maker in their class room, they can call the  teacher using their phone.

The teacher may send any student within eyesight to detention. All they need to do is point to the student and say their name and they will be sent to detention.

Once in detention a student must stay there for 3 minutes. After the full three minutes if they are a trouble maker, they are converted to being a student. However, if a student is in detention for the full 3 minutes they become trouble makers!

A trouble maker may sneak over to detention and let the other trouble makers out. Any students released from detention in this way also become trouble makers.

## End of Game
The game ends when either a majority of the students become trouble makers or a majority become teachers pets

# Extended Rules
Trouble makers can't see what the homework of each class room is
If trouble makers get over 50% of the students turned into trouble makers, the teacher loses their special abilities
