Boot Fall is a 2 player Paper sport.

The object of the game is to be the first player to score 2 Touchdowns.

### You will need:
- 5 different offense tokens
- 3 Defense tokens
- 5 index cards and something to write with
- A timer

## Setup
- Print out the attached field sheet!
![[8.5x11 1.png]]
- On the index cards write a word that identifies each of the unique offense tokens
	*For example: if you're using 5 pieces of different colors, write the color on each of the cards*
- Each player pick a side of the field and randomly determines who is the HOME TEAM and who is the AWAY TEAM.
- The Home team starts on Offense: place the offense pieces in the zone adjacent to the Home Team Endzone.
- Place the defense pieces in the zone adjacent to the offense pieces
	*Each zone has five spaces. Pieces may be placed however you like within the zone, so long as there are not more than 3 pieces in one space.*
- Set the timer to 20 seconds.

## Gameplay
Whoever is playing as the Offense picks a card from their hand and plays it face down on the table. This is the piece who will have the ball. Keep this a secret!

The Offense then places pieces however they like in their Zone remembering that there can only be three pieces in any one space.

The Defense may then place their pieces however they like in their zone.

Then start the clock. For the next 20 seconds, each player may move their pieces around within their zone as much as they like, again only allowing three pieces in any one space at a time. When the timer stops both players must immediately let go of the pieces.

Any offensive piece that has a defensive piece in a space directly opposite it is blocked. If there are more offensive pieces in a space than defensive blockers, the offense decides which piece is blocked and which piece isn't.

At this time reveal the played card. If the corresponding offensive piece was blocked, a completion didn't happen. Discard the played card and try again, choosing a player only from the reamaining cards in your hand. After 3 unsuccessful attempts, turn the ball over to the other player (see **Turn Over** below.)

If the piece was not blocked, a completion happens- move the offensive and defensive pieces 1 zone closer to the endzone of the player currently playing defense. The offensive player picks up any discarded cards and begins a new round with all five cards. 

### Scoring a Touchdown
If a completion would take your team into the oposing teams endzone, instead score a touchdown. If at this time you have score 2 touchdowns, you win the game.

If the game is not over, turn the ball over to the defensive player. The new offensive player places their pieces in the zone adjacent to their own endzone. The new defensive player places their pieces in the zone adjacent to the offense.

Begin a new round.

### Turn over
If the offensive player has failed 3 consecutive completions (ie there are now three discarded cards), they turn the ball over to the oposing team. Place the defensive pieces in the zone that the offensive pieces we just in and place the offenseive pieces in the zone th defensive pieces were just in (ie SWITCH the locations of the Offense and Defense). Give the Offense cards to the new offensive player and begin a new round at this location.
