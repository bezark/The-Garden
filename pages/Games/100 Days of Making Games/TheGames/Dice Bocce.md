# Dice Boccee
#me/anxiety/stressed 
   
   Ok so I said I would make a game with 2 dice next but here's one with 6. This seems very playable and would love to play it with some of y'all soon! I definitely need to reconfigure my process though- I am finding that making these is happening in weird spurts of energy and still takes longer than it should. I am definitely curious about how to prototype with less paper and more efficiently. All good learning though! [[itp100days]] [[NYUdaily]]
