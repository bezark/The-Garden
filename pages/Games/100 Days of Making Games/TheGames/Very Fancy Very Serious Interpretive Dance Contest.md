A game of very serious artful competitive dance for 4+ players

All the judges will each need index cards labeled 1-5 (or I suppose 5 fingers on a hand...)
The will need a paper and writing implement each though.

[This Prompt Generator](https://editor.p5js.org/JohnBezark/present/0fOgsT3o1)

# Setup
Very Fancy Very Serious Interpretive Dance Contest is game of very fancy and very serious interpretive dance. Each player will have the opportunity to devise a very good interpretive dance and each player will have the opportunity to judge dances by other players.  To play, decide which player will be dancing first. All the other players take on the role of judges for the round.

- Dancer: use the prompt generator to receive a secret phrase that is to be the driving centerpiece of your dance. This is the theme you're trying to communicate to the judges. Choreograph a 2 minute dance on this theme.
- Judges: use the prompt generator to receive the 3 categories you will be judging for this round.

# Gameplay
Each dancer picks a prompt from the prompt deck and then has 2 minutes to develop a VERY FANCY VERY SERIOUS INTERPATIVE DANCE that conveys the theme they have drawn along with the depth of the human spirit.

They may use any accompanying music if they like. Their Dance should be no longer than three minutes.

Players who are not currently dancers are judges. They must watch the performance and give thoughtful critique and insight. Specifically, they will receive 3 random categories that they must score the dancer on their performance from 1-5 points in each category. The categories can be anything ranging from "Form of Austerity" to "Density of Head Wiggling". Esteemed categories indeed. Judges should score one category at a time and must reveal their scores simultaneously.

Dancers are awarded points equal to their combined score, and judges will earn 2 bonus points per score that aligns with another judge. There are standards after all and they must be upheld! 

Judges then write down the title of the piece they think the dancer received. Dancer and Judge alike receive 4 points per exact word and 2 points per synonym guessed in the title. (Interstitial words such as of, and, the etc. do not count)

Then rotate around and begin a new round of choreographing and evaluating. For the faint of heart, you may stop after one full round, but the true interpreters of interpretive dance will only have their appetites sated after 31 rounds. Regardless of how many rounds you complete, the player with the highest score at the end of the contests is CLEARLY the best dancer and must be awarded one very black very tall turtleneck and should give a speech about the existential void that has been engendered by Martha Grahm's Crackers.
