Royal Party Pairs is a social party game for 4-13 Players
The vibe is very high society with a LOT of steamy elopement. Big Bridgerton energy.

# Setup
You'll need 2 cards of each number descending from Ace per player in the hearts and spades suites.

*HUH?!?!?*

If you're playing with 6 people, take 2 Aces, 2 Kings, 2 Queens, 2 Jacks, 2 Tens and 2 Nines. If you're playing with 4 People, only take 2 Aces, 2 Kings, 2 Queens, 2 Jacks. All of these would be in hearts and spades.

THEN swap out the lowest two cards for the 2 jokers- who invited them to this party???

Each player will also need a unique token (this could be unused cards)

You will also need "rooms" equal to the number of players divided by 2 rounded up. Eg 3 players- make 2 rooms, 8 players- make 4 rooms.

You'll also need a d6 or something to track the time.

# Object of the game
You're all swanky royal guests attending a swanky swingers party! 
The object of the game is to end the night with the sauciest couple at the party ie the best pair of cards according to these rules:
- A pair of jokers is THE strongest hand
- After that Pairs descending from ace are stongest, for those are the bonds of true love!
- Then Two sequential numbers of a matched suit because similaraties attract
- Then Two sequential numbers of different suits beacus "hey, I guess we're close enough"
-  Then Highest individual because "woof we just had a bad night"

Note: if two players have the same hand but in opposite suites, the player with the higher card in the hearts suite has the higher score.

# Gameplay
On your turn you can do one of three possible things:
- Move to a new room
- Engage in a  sultry affair!
- If there are at least two other players in a room with you may initate a rockous orgy.

## Moving your player
- Move your player to a new room. Pretty Straight forward.

## Engage in a sultry affair
- Pick a player in the same room as you.
- You and the other player pick a card to exchange from your hands

## Initate a Rockous Orgy!
- If there are more than two other players in the room with you you may inaite a rockous orgy
- Everyone in the room shuffles their hands together and draws a new hand

Once everyone has taken a turn, tick the round counter up by one.
The sun rises after 5 rounds.

At that time reveal your final couples and score them accordingly.


# A note on roleplaying and consent
This is a silly game of repressed fancy royalty who are all jonesing to get it on. All of the encounters in this game are entirely consensual. The cards go where their hearts desire! If you're ever at a REAL LIFE steamy royal sex party it is VERY IMPORTANT to ask for consent. Also no joker shaming!

When playing with a group, agree before hand to the amount or "roleplaying" your going to do- are you getting very graphic or are you speaking entirely in metaphor? Or are you just playing for the mechanics? Is this even a sex party? You could absolutely just be making friends or networking. But also, sex positivity is a good thing!
