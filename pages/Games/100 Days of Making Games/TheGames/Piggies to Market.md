Add the rest of the animals to the general supply.
Give each player $5

Determine a player who stocks up first.

The player who did not stock up first, takes the first turn

# Game Play
%%The game consists of round and in each round each player can take either 2 or three actions. %%
The game consists of rounds and in each round each players take three actions in alternating order. 
Actions you can take are:
- Buying animals
- Breeding animals
- Scrounge for Cash
- Changing orders
- Fulfilling orders

%%The first player in the round will consist of 2 actions in a row or 3 actions alternated%%

## Buying animals
You can always buy animals from the animal stock for the price adjacent to the lowest filled space on the animal stock table. 

When buying animals, you can purchase as many as you like with one action. Once one animal is purchased, take the animal from the animal stock table, add it to your supply and immediadely apply the new price of the animal. 

## Breeding animals
When you breed your animals you may gain one additional animal for every 2 animals you have of that type up to a maximum of 4 animals total. For example, If you had 3 pigs, 4 cows and one sheep, when you breed animals you would gain 1 pig and 2 cows. Take these animals from the generaly supply, NOT the animal stock table. If the supply ever runs out, you may use stand ins.

## Changing Orders
As an action, you may swap an order on the market board with an order that is to the left or right of it.

## Scrounging for Cash
As an action you may take $1

## Fulfilling orders
As an action, you may fulfill any orders that have a $ value benath them. Trade in the number of animals shown and gain the amount of money shown beneath the card. If there are any empty spaces in the animal stock, fill them up with these animals because, you know maybe they don't get instantly butchered and turned into meat, maybe people just want farmyard pets ok???

Remove the order and add it to your completed orders pile. If at this time you have completed 5 orders, you win the game!

## End of the Round
After each player has take three actions, the round ends. Slide all the cards down the board one space. If a card slides off the board, add it to the discard pile. Draw the top card of the market deck and place it in the left most space of the market board. If the Market deck is empty, shuffle the discard pile and create a new market deck.
