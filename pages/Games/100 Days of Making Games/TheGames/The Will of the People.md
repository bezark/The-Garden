*The Will of the People* is a game of secret objective and political machinations. There are Four different political factions and each faction has it's own win condition. The Four factions are:
- Conservative: Try to just make it through 6 years without any big changes
- Progressive: Make big changes!
- Anarchist: Start the revolution!
- Fascists: Rise to power. 

# Setup
Draw faction cards per number of players. Ensure that the factions are evenly distributed.
Secretly deal out the faction cards one to a player. Keep these identities hidden.

%%Think about having the parties be explicit and the roles hidden?%%

Everyone close their eyes. Each faction open their eyes and see the other members of your faction.

Then place cards on the board in the following configuration:
![[IMG_4464.JPG]]. Include the Minister with the "move the will of the people" power in the appointed section.

Then hold an election! Everyone who is not in jail at the beginning of each round votes on all the elected officials. At the start of the game Determine who is the President and who is the prime minister.

The President then appoints a player to be a General and another player to be Secretary 

Hand out the corresponding role cards to all officials.

Set the "Will of the People" tracker to 1, the "System is Broken" tracker to 0, the year tracker to 1 and the bills passed tracker to 0.

# Gameplay
## Object of the Game
- Conservative: Complete 6 years without passing 8 pieces of legislation
- Progressive: Pass 8 pieces of legislation 
- Anarchist: Break the system so that the will of the people moves into "Revolution"
- Fascist: consolidate power on one fascist- assign 3 powers to one role and end the round with a fascist in that role.

## Playing a Round
At the start of a round, elect all electable positions. Anyone who is not in jail may run for office. All players vote on who should be elected. In the event of a tie, the position goes to the incumbent. If the position is empty, fill it randomly. Then appoint any appointable officials. At the start of the game this ability is held by the president but that may change.

Everyone who is not appointed or elected becomes a legislator and takes a pair of yay and nay cards

Then pass legislation!

## Passing legislation
Whoever has the ability to Propose Laws (the Prime Minister at the start of the game) may propose up to 3 laws per round. A law consist of moving one card on the board, either shifting a role to from elected to appointed or vice versa, or moving an ability to a new role. When moving a role, keep any attached abilities on the role.

The prime minister proposes the legislation and the legislators then secretly vote yay or nay. Legislation only passes in the event of a majority vote.

Up to three laws may be passeed in a single round.

Abide by these rules going forward.

### Obeying the Will of the People
The people have a strict amount of progress they expect, as represented by their current score on the will of the people track. Move their frusteration up for whatever the difference is between their expectations and the number of bills passed.
*For example: if they are at 2 and 3 bills are passed, move them up one. If they are at 1 and 0 bills are passed, also move them up one.* 

If the people are 'content', instead of moving them up one, make them 'frusterated'. If they are content their expectations are met, move their frusteration down one.

## Interrogation, Arrests and Moving the Will
Any of the follwoing abilities may be exicuted at any point during the round.

Whoever has the ability to Interrogate may look at any players party affiliation card. They are the only player who may see this card.

Whoever has the ability to make arrests may at any point during the round arrest any other player. This player immediately loses any role card they had and are sent to jail. They are to remain in jail until the end of the next round.

Whoever has the ability to move the will of the people may move the will of the people tracker to the left or the right one space.

## Released From Jail
At this point any player in jail is now realeased from jail.

## Check for Victory
If at this point, any faction has met their victory condition, they win. If multiple factions achieve victory at this time, they all win.
