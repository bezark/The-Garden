Building on [[Overthrow the Government]]

Thinking about ways to improve on overthrow the governement:

- There are 4 political parties:
	- Progressives
	- Conservatives
	- Fascists
	- Anarchists

Each have different goals:
- Fascists: Consolidate power on a stron perons. Get the ability to arrest, appoint and make laws all on one figure
- Anarchists: get everyone thrown in jail? get the people to overthrow the government.
	- There is a political will tracker
	- Fristeration that builds
- Progressives and conservatives want to enact their policy positions or they want to elect their party leader 3 times?
- There is a tracker for what is possible and what isn't
- there are little cubes you move around 
- there are different events that trigger certain situations?
- there are the people who must be satisfied
- there are people who run as either one party or another and then there are secret roles people have

So maybe everyone affiliates ACTUALLY with one party, but then within that there are different abilities to make things happen?

So like you're outwardly a conservative but inwardly an anarchist or a plutocrat or a comprimised person so you need your dirt to nt get out

Maybe you ther

maybe frusteration builds up if there is not deciscive action taken?
maybe there are things that happen if you are waiting too long to make moves?

Simplified:
- There are four parties
- they all have a secret win condition

The ability to arrest seems a little confused. Abilities are:
- appoint, elect, make laws, arrest, interrogate.

Objectives are: get elected, consolidate power, break the system, pass legislation
make things happen

Maybe different card configurations are more points in different directions.

Maybe it's a color matching thing or a suite combination thing
Maybe there are these overlapping patterns you make that score different ideological victories
maybe by getting multiple things in a row that happens
ANd maybe there are elected reps like missions in avalon and then they either vote for or agains certain legislation. Maybe anyone whoe is not appointed becomes elected?
I didn't love in the last one how you need to be in power to do anything? I  guess that something I would like to improve upon in
