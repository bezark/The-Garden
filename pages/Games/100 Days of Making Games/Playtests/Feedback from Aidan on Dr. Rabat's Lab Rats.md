Using live video to support a game is such exciting territory, and this sketch has some very clear game mechanics.  A few thoughts if you were to build this idea further:  

-   there is an opportunity for the interface to support the story around the game (of a science lab, of being rats, etc.)  Perhaps the video itself is altered to appear as though from a CCTV camera with scan lines, etc.
-   Is there an onboarding and offboarding that helps establish our roles (i.e. who is squeaker and  who is guesser)?
-   One small thing: sometimes I was asked to guess, but the required emoji didn't appear to be present...  Maybe you could check that all of the emojis are being shown?
