# Notes
- I found it hard to earn money
	- (prices of animals very high and scrounging very weak)
	- Also breeding is crazy maybe should be agricola style
- Have a barn/ storage amount
- Trickle back thing? Like the when the market is empty it sort of slows down

# Post Game Questions
Overall Thoughts:
- Pretty easy in that there was not a real constraint on your ability to grow.
	- Infinite animals+ breeding made it really not stressful
- Money wasn't that helpful partifularly with breeding

## What was the most frustrating moment or aspect of what you just played?
- Swapping arbitrarly
	- didn't really amount to anything
	- Why did we have the option if you could just do it forever
	- Maybe pay a dollar to do it?

## What was your favorite moment or aspect of what you just played?
Infinite breeding was nice, filling market was nice. Waiting for orders was nice

## Was there anything you wanted to do that you couldnâ€™t?

## How would you describe this game to your friends and family?
