# Notes
- whisteling the bridge- was confusing
- maybe there needs to be sounds on
- also they didn't turn their location on
- maybe there needs to be a clear opt in
- under or over bridge 
- really didn't see that little button
- Page scrolled weird ?
- definitely helpful that cookies are there-they switched apps frequently
- Had to show button
video didnt auto play
	maybe this is a safari issue???
Auto play didn't work across the board

couldn't play through the game.

This was a really important test for me- I learned several important things both about the game and about web dev:
- The opt in for geo location needs to be more explicitly a part of the process
- Autoplay videos does NOT work on mobile
- There is a very hand chrome mobile console at chrome://inspect.

More importantly: this test felt like a FAILURE because I didn't share the actual fully playable game. However, this was an incredibly useful session. I learned real things that I can take with me as long as I am able to look pas my embarassement and need to feel like I'm showcasing 'finished products'. The trap of 100 Days is feeling like I need to share finished things. That is not the point- practice and process. This was another bout of learning and I'm greatful for the oppertunity. :)
