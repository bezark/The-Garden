Just finished playtesting [[Piggies to Market]] and had a good time.

Thinking about [[Last 7 Games]] and what I want to do, I think I'll try making a sport next

You need to lauch hairties
need to hit a ball on a string
chase your cat around the house
hide a small item in a park

I spy with things you saw yesterday
musical chairs with no chairs and no music

Keeping baloons off the ground
kicking a ball back and forth
4 baskets 

trying to defend these little cups
flick a pencil back and forth
Toss a ring onto a stick
Toss a colored thing into another colored thing
on player wears glasses that make them color blind

Hide an object in the house
competitive finding
You both need to pick up something with your non dominant hand
you need to switch your hands and your feet

You need to find a detail hidded in plain sight

Construct a message from words in your environemnt

You can only stand on one foot at a time and you need to knock the other player over with your shoulder

Ice sliding- slide an ice cube back and forth

Do something by the time an ice cube melts
slide it back and forth, if it's on your side and turns to water you loose

You need to toss a bananna back and forth

Hide a secret message in fruit

Hide an object on your body

One person is a spy the other is the TSA
Pack a suitcase with stuff and try to smuggle something across

roll a grape down a ramp

Make a tower of pizza? Use those little pizza tables

Let a candle burn all the way down. Use an hour glass

Attach an object to a string, make a pendulum etc.

Make a little race car

A game that uses hotwheels

A game that uses action figures
monster royale
Dice rolling war game for monster smashing
They knock over buildings etc

Shoe toss, toss a shoe with a shoe and hit it with a shoe. But don't touch the shoe with anything other than a shoe!
Shoe-ball! a Shoe-sport

A hat throwing contest- get your hat on the coat rack
hide different things behind towels. A towel game show

There are two teams on a big field but you don't know who is on what team.
Soccer but you don't know who is on your team
