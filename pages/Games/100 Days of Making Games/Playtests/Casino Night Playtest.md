Casino Night Playtest
[[Casino Night]] actually went pretty well- didn't take any formal playtest notes, butI learned a lot about larps? I guess the red chip was a little hard to earn, but that was kind of nice. It definitely took some real prodding to get people to go to Viola, but that's in part because there wasn't really too much you could do other than play games. People didn't think to talk to people etc. Also it really points to the importance ofcharacter in a big way- I had acharacter and tora and viola had characters, but the lack of clarity on who those characters were made it hard to respond to people.

Also I didn't think about what happened when you ran out of money
