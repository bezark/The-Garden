# Feedback:
- Have a timer for conversations like speed dating
- Max out the number of people
- Some sort of conditions for triggering monster transformations
	- A little too easy for monsters to just saunter up and convert folks

Well that was hilarious. This playtest was certainly chaotic. Was it a playable game- Sort of? Did People have fun? I think so?

I tested this game with 8 players and I had a hard time articulating the rules I had made to the group- In my haste/anxiousness about sharing my game I didn't take the time to really step through things and I forgot to mention to the monster that they could only infect one person at a time. Or perhaps I never wrote that in the rules? I also had a hilariously hard time using the platform. Anyway this sort of immediately tipped the game into chaos.

It's funny with these games because they are built fairly quickly and often have a number of holes in them. It's hilarious/agonizing when you playtest something rough because you sort of immediately become aware of what doesn't work with the game you made and then it's a matter of deciding if you should stop it or if you just watch the carcrash in slow motion.

But that's the real thing- the root of the problem- the assumption that because things are not playing out the way you envisioned that it's car crash. In fact it seemed like folks did have a fair amount of fun playing this game and I learned interesting things by just seeing what happened. And they came to me with great suggestions.

I met with [[Greg Treffery]] the other day and he suggested that in designing games I should "playtest early and playtest often". I am starting to understand what that means I think: instead of fully baking something abstractly, there is value in testing it first. Test the root of the activity and try to feel out the fun. Maybe incrementally. Maybe atomically.

# Looking Forwards

Tomorrow is a new day. There's a lot of fun things that have happened recently:
- I tested Magical Candy Factory
- Anticipate A Day is coming along
- I just tested Monster Conference

Out of all that some threads to pull on are:
- Refining and simplifying the mechanics from Magical candy factory. Maybe just hone in on what the mechanic is for resolving challenges. How can I make that fun? Maybe I can develop that as a standalone game.
