Game:[[Build a Town]][[Race to Build a Town]]
Date: [[2021-03-29]]

---


Was pretty punishing 
went down to one health
foraging was not really a consideration
\
Kept thinking it was 4 food total for the house
Deck didn't get shuffled
Forraging deck should only get shuffled when done
4 was too much

---

Race 

Unclear if there were always choices or if it felt like there was not enough options
forfeited a turn because of movement
foraging seemed stressful
	or not fruitful
maybe need a more guaranteed way to get seeds
Traveling inhibited action
	Couldn't get to the field on time
