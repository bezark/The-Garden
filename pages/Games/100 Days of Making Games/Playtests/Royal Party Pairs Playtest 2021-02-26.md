# Looking Backwards
- It was quite fun. I liked the swapping cartds. I liked the theme
- I like the strategy that semed to emerge
- I want there to be more intersting cards
- I want there to be more strategic movement
	- I like making more spaces and giving movement to adjacent spaces and only soing two actions
- But I also don't want to overcvomplicate it
- I want there to be a better way to change your lot
- I want there to be more chaos

# Thoughts on the playtest itself
- Definitely was more successful than previous attempts
- I liked playingcards.io but it was a little bit broken
	- Or atleast cumbersome
- I think in future it would be good to try and do more tests with smaller groups- test a game at least twice or simething
- also I should come up with questions in advance
- and I should take notes during the test itself
- 

# Looking Forwards
- I like this social game kick
- and i like cards
- am i done with cards?
- I could keep working with them at least in the sense that they offer easy identity
- I like this players and identities thing
- and rooms
- I want to make a game that has to be in a several spaces
- I think I just want to make 2 rooms and a boom
	- which I guess i could doooooi
- There's nothing stopping me from just ripping games 
- or using them as starting places
- maybe I just start with several locations and identities
- teams
- groups working together.
- COuld be good. idk
