Game: [[Dice Bocce]]
Date: [[2021-02-16]]

---
I playtested [[Dice Bocce]] on the floor of ITP for the first time today and learned some valuable things:
- The Score of 21 is too high. We played 3 rounds and the score was 8-3. Perhaps something more manageable like 13 would be good.
- On a smooth surface you definitely need to tape down the paper.
- I think generally there are too many choices- 6 points is really a lot. Maybe if you used custom dice that had 3 choices on them. Or if you only had even and odd scoring places. Or a spot for 1-3 and a spot for 4-6.
- It seemed fun if not a little difficult.
