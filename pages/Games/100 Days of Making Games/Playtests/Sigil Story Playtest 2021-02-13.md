Game: [[Sigil Story]]
Date: [[2021-02-13]]

---

Today I did a playtest of [[Sigil Story]]! I am making [[ITP/100Days/Blog/TheGames/Adjustments to my 100 Days of Making Process]] and am now conducting regular playtests with people other than myself. My first playtest was with my partner Benny and you can listen to my interview of them below:

# Looking Backwards
- I really enjoyed writing a story as a central mechanic.
- I felt confused sometimes about how to proceed in the story- it felt a little broad and I wanted a bit more guidance or more mechanics.
- It would be cool if this resulted in a little Zine you got to keep. 
	- Maybe it's a printable sheet and there are introductions and world building on the first couple of pages
- I still want to explore how to make forking paths and a more ''[[choose your own adventure]] setup.
- I think the titles of the events felt a little New Age-ey to me.
- I wonder what it would be like to expand the event number
- I wonder what the framing is here in regards to time- how often are you supposed to do this?
- Also are there things you can do on days other than just write?
- Could you do physical activities with each prompt?
- Can this build to something more cohesive than just a paper with different sections at the end (like a zine or a letter or a book)

# Looking Forwards
Tomorrow I want to take the idea of a written card based 1 player vaguely tarot-ey game and see if I can make it a choose your own adventure instead. I think I'll expand the number of cards and options, but instead of just a random order of events, I want to explore ways to have deliberate paths and routes.
I also want to explore activities of different duration, although if it becomes a game to be played over a long period of time, I suppose that will be hard to playtest.

I can't just sit with what I have though, so I will need to make some real adjustments. I think they will be:
- removing writing
- Adding prompts for activity
- Finding a different event structure.
- Giving it a different theme?

See this is interesting because at the outset, that feels like work that can be done in a day- the question becomes if I am reflecting and planning as part of the 3rd day, do I really need a whole day to start again?

OMG but also I am over complicating it. AND I'm already breaking my rule- I am clearly taking more than two components with me- a "a written card based 1 player vaguely tarot-ey" is three things:
- 1 player 
- Tarot themed
- Card based

I guess I will say then that I am sticking with a 1 player game Tarot themed game. The rest I'll have to reinvent!
