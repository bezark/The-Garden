# Mantel poem
Smoke now
And an empty bag
Billows out the horizon
With Suspension
And tension.
Wisdom or erosion
Whichever they are, there is difference now in what makes up the stuff-ness of it all.
Beneath the surface of the earth
beneath the topsoil and paving
The rocks are different
Dog chow and hay-pennies
Crustal and metamorphosed
Super heated and phase changed into something here to for totally unknown. 
waiting yet to be dug up a hundred thousand years from now.
