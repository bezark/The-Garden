[[Digital Performance]] [[theater]] 
You could have a live action play- or a text adventure that people could only experience in real time.
You log on to a site, you pay a ticket, you get sent to a site.
It's blank.
It's waiting- the time strikes
you get a message-
you unlock a fictional written thing.
As you read it in real time, people are on call
you begin to see films appear that seem to reflect real details that you just input
it starts as a written thing
then it starts to feel alive
it starts to feel like it's in real time
it picks up velocity
it becomes a live performance
