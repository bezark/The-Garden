# Move Along Poem
Down town
Out town
Emerging and ejection
Burn the rail
Hold the seat with the small of your back
Hunched and procesing all there is in any given day
The burning of your already going eyes
Hold up and held up
Follow not and forgot
There is not now nor never will there be anywhere near enough
Play the song out so many times it loses all shape and meaning
Let it corrode your rhythm
Pulsate your body and re form itself from nothing into something into nothing again 
It all just comes and goes
Wealthy and waiting empty handed
Who needs keepsakes anyways?
