[Future Knowledges and the Dilemmas of Decolonization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa5NUW7aQAI)

There are generational problems with sharing knowledge in that the younger generations are radicically changing.

Also knowledge is not being contained by institutions now

traditional teaching is changing- the calssroom is shifting to a community of learning where there are horizontal learning 

"Our encounters with te world no longer allow us to accept orthodox thinking"

Huge Shifts in how we think about time. REWATCH this at about 8min

# Big Epistemological Shifts
- Fragmentation of disciplines 
	- So many disciplines that knowledge is thoroughly confused
- Velocity of "Turns"

- "We humans are not as special as we once thought" This is a big deal because the Humanitites are built on the idea that we are special
	- Another foundational statement is "Some are more special than others"

There's been a distinction between humanity and nature- Society [[Nature]] (connected to [[Zurkow Ideas]] [[Zurkow Conversation]])

The Fundamental Questioning of Cartesian Objectivity - Subject vs Object. The Drive is to perceive the Agency of all the various no human agents we interact with ^testy

So what does the Humanities mean in [[The Age of Entanglement]]

- Cognition is not limited to living single organisms
- Knowledge does not just reside in the brain but also in the environment and [[Epigenetics]]

We are returning to BIG questions- what constitutes HUMAN life
and HOW do we preserve aspects of our "life" and our "selves" while also 

Algorithmic Thinking- the creatinon of reasonig machinces has cast a shadow on deductive reasoning and the uniqueness of human reasoning

In a big way we a re headed for a re organization of our ontology of NUMBERS. Numbers are not relegated to the domain of computation and calculation but increasingly, with non-human cognition, they are the language of creativity and imagination ^4xv7gy

*I realize i have had a deep fear of Machine Learning because I thought it was*

We don't have a seperation between human and earth

more Notes
biological though being replaced by abstract systems
