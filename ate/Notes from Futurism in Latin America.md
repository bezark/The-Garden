What was global about modernism? For years now we have seen academic positions, conferences, and books urging correctives to the Eurocentric historiography of modern art and literature and challenging us to think about modernities and modernisms

modernism now is seen as a global but contradictory phenomenon with profoundly different temporalities and manifestations in its multiple locations.

futurism in Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking America during the 1920s

Since the 1909 publication of the “Manifesto of Futurism,” which appeared contemporaneously in multiple languages, futurism aspired to establish a globalized avant-garde. Yet by analyzing the networks of communication between Latin American intellectuals as well as the cultural specificities of Hispanophone and Lusophone America, the contributors to this volume transcend the model of “center-periphery” implicit in F. T. Marinetti’s concept of “world futurism”

in Latin America too “futurism” often did not stand for a specific, Italian-born avant-garde movement but for a generic “modern.” As news about the movement arrived sporadically to Latin America—often mediated by the agendas of intellectuals living in Europe at the time—futurism was seen as equivalent to “avant-garde,” “experimental,” and “fascinated with technology.”

The lack of precise knowledge about the movement allowed for a freer interpretation of futurism and for its engagement far beyond the parameters of Italian futurism.

Mendes de Abreu concludes that Mário de Andrade, Oswald de Andrade, Rubens Borba de Moraes, and Mário da Silva Brito (among others) did not merely apply futurist tenets but rather actively transformed and repurposed them “to focus on language as a reflection of the cultural models of the time”

unexpected connections between futurism and Uruguayan anarchism.

The editors of this volume point out that “the double act of Americanism/Cosmopolitanism was the foundational matrix of the Latin American avant-gardes”

modernismo—the first Latin America-born literary movement to profoundly shape Spanish-language culture between 1880 and 1920

As a movement that rejected the immediate past and reclaimed a “primitive” heritage in order to revive twentieth-century culture, futurism encouraged the creation of multiple centers for modern art.

futurism was, for many Latin Americans, a useful tool to combat their own conservative artistic tradition as well as Europe’s stifling cultural influence.

the fusion of art and politics—and the iconoclasm—of futurism were welcomed by some Latin American intellectuals living in Europe. The futurist cult of the new was seen as a tool to spur an intercontinental and hemispheric artistic dialogue that was politically committed and aesthetically innovative:

Futurism was also a useful point of departure for Latin American avant-gardes that reclaimed indigenous and vernacular traditions to challenge the art establishment in their own countries and in Europe.

indigenous culture was promoted using futurist genres and poetic forms, as well as exalting technology and the dynamism of urban life.

Writing on Caribbean avant-garde poets like José Z. Tallet, Luis Palés Matos, and Alejo Carpentier, Ramiro Armas Austria analyzes how they responded to the futurist manifestoes on radio and cinema by deploying elements of their American and African heritage in order to defy Eurocentric aesthetic canons.

“constitutive element of Brazilian modernism” because of its challenge to the traditional channels for the production and consumption of culture,

Yet sometimes futurism also laid bare the contradictions of Latin American intellectuals, who mostly belonged to a white or criollo middle or upper class that was appropriating the indigenous and the vernacular.

The favela, mostly inhabited by the Afro-Brazilian working class, was alternately described by Brazilian modernists as the authentic core of Brazil and as a dangerous space that should be razed in order to fully modernize Rio de Janeiro.

Region-specific modern social forms and aesthetics profoundly shaped the reception, and ultimately the rejection, of futurism in Latin America

both movements engaged with futurism and cubism in order to “construct modern figurations of the national,” yet also as a way of “‘nationalizing’ the modern”

ideologies (whether aesthetic or political) manifest themselves geographically”

Most of the Latin American artists and intellectuals addressed in this volume identified futurism with the theories exposed in the 1909 manifesto, rather than with the developments of the movement in the 1910s and 1920s

As many contributors to the volume point out, the Latin American reception of futurism was shaped by profound misunderstandings of futurist politics, which, in reality, covered the entire political spectrum from the far left to the far right.3 Despite what we now know to have been the complicated relation between futurism and fascism, news about the rapprochement of Marinetti with Benito Mussolini conditioned the responses to his visits to Latin America in the interwar period.

Marinetti expanded on what he saw as subconscious similarities between futurism and fascism, such as “the desire to use muscular force; that they identify with the violence of the sexual act; that they are in essence carnal
