[The Architechts of Abolitionism Talk](https://youtu.be/z9rvRsWKDx0)

Smart writer

celebratory moment with the aqquital of [[Angela Davis]], but drifiting away from the core thing 
the core vision of freedom

The architechts of revolution have been turned into commodities

By deradicalizing the prison struggle and by shifting the leadership to the oppressors 

The ideneties that we claim when engaging in revolutionary work- we have to be very careful if we aren't those identities

Also the leaders of revolutionary movements have been claimed by the academy
	meaning claimed by white people and the state/ romanticization
	making it inaccessible to BIPOC or the broader public
	
"We don't condem the states ability to interfere and destroy people's lives, we shift to mitigating the damage. That's a different game."
