Museum as portal!
A doorway gat or entrance. A portal. 
[[Origins of Museums]]
Genius is collective
arsitss as 

Visibility -> Knowability -> Extraction.

>The Museum is a product of cultural technology, employing displays to create an 'other', taxonomy to communicate 'place', derealization to isolate space and opacity to perform a seemingly nutral authority of knowledge

The rise of the museum was linked to the rise of the university and of the prison.
All three used to link a totality of worldview

How to reimagine a museum as a *portal* something that feels *expansive*

We keep recreating white-cube muesumes and spaces. And we are entrenched in carceral logic. Policing- is much more than just an activity, but is in fact a modality

Portals as community based and Community dependent. The Community is a stakeholder. Sort of like an internet cafe

When looted artifacts are returned, they are still displayed in colonial ways

# Reflections 

I found this whole series of presentations really interesting and really relevant to my studies- I was particularly resonating with Yaa Addae's thoughts on re-imagining Museums as Portals and given that I'm taking a class called 'Desiging for Museums' right now I found it particularly timely. I was really taken with the insight that Museums, Prisons and Universities all originated at around the same time and that they reinforce almost a Trinity of 'Carceral Logic'- prisons enforce literal Laws and impose physical punishments and restrictions, universities indoctrinate and reaffirm existing modes of interpreting reality, and museums codify and stratify our understanding of the world. I really appreciated the insight that by putting things behind glass with labels we other, and by classifying we recreate hierarchies that reinforce colonialism and White Supremacy.

I really liked Yaa's ideas about imagining shared public spaces for envisioning possible futures- a question that it opened up for me is 'how can we still talk about the past?' How can museums be both community sourced and community supported while still bringing knowledge and histories from outside that community? Is it ethical for museums to even do that? Is there a way to share information from the past without perpetuating colonial histories? I don't know but I'm very interested to keep thinking about it.
