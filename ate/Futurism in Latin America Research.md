I decided to dig into the Futurism movement of the 1920s, but I wanted to see how it impacted other countries other than Italy and Europe. I decided to focus on how this Futurism traveled and translated to Latin America in the 1920s. I found a great article on Called *Futurism in Latin America* from the  International Yearbook of Futurism Studies[^1] and here are some of my findings:

Notably, "modernism now is seen as a global but contradictory phenomenon with profoundly different temporalities and manifestations in its multiple locations." This is really apt- there are many movements in many localities and it's really worthwhile to separate the ways that different versions of movements manifest themselves. 

What was really interesting about [[Italian Futurism]] in Latin America was that while it was based on the overall ideas of Italian Futurism, the "Latin American reception of futurism was shaped by profound misunderstandings of futurist politics, which, in reality, covered the entire political spectrum from the far left to the far right." I know there was a clear correlation between Futurism and Fascism in Italy, but I'm unclear what this is implying about Futurism in Latin America.

Interestingly though, Latin American Futurism, actually meant something closer to Modernism, in that it expanded widely from Italian Futurism:

>in Latin America too “futurism” often did not stand for a specific, Italian-born avant-garde movement but for a generic “modern.” As news about the movement arrived sporadically to Latin America—often mediated by the agendas of intellectuals living in Europe at the time—futurism was seen as equivalent to “avant-garde,” “experimental,” and “fascinated with technology.”

This is particularly interesting: futurism traveled to Latin America from Italy, but in so doing it lost some of it's specificity. The article also aptly points out that "futurism was, for many Latin Americans, a useful tool to combat their own conservative artistic tradition as well as Europe’s stifling cultural influence" and that it was "a useful point of departure for Latin American avant-gardes that reclaimed indigenous and vernacular traditions to challenge the art establishment in their own countries and in Europe."

Latin American Futurists routinely employed "elements of their American and African heritage in order to defy Eurocentric aesthetic canons" and "indigenous culture was promoted using futurist genres and poetic forms".

While this may seem ideal, it also brought about it's own set of problems: many Latin American Intellectuals belonged to "a white or criollo middle or upper class" and they were in fact "appropriating the indigenous and the vernacular."
A striking example:
>The favela, mostly inhabited by the Afro-Brazilian working class, was alternately described by Brazilian modernists as the authentic core of Brazil and as a dangerous space that should be razed in order to fully modernize Rio de Janeiro.

All things considered, it seems like the Futurists of the 1920s in Latin America explored really interesting terrain, and I would be interested in learning more about them.
