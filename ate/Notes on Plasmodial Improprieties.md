[[Slime Mold]] [[Emergence]] [[Octavia Butler]] [[2021-04-13]] ^a541b6

> Butler has often fabulated species that embody symbiogenesis, which highlights cooperation rather than competition in describing the organization and evolution of complex life

Symbiogenesis!

 

In fabulating the Oankali, Butler has drawn much from what could be considered slime mold’s queerest properties: nondimorphic sexuality, trans-species chemo-tactile communication, and nonhierarchi- cal sociality. In these ways, slime mold behavior itself speaks to femi-queer notions of collectivity and nonhierarchical social formations.

while there may very well be a slime mold ontology beyond human understanding, one ethical way to reach across to that speculative reality might be to wonder with it, rather than marvel at it from a distance.  

Such consideration puts Butler’s fabulations and Evelyn Fox Keller’s research on slime mold aggregation in a more capa- cious feminist genealogy of nonhierarchical organizing that might include, for example, Jasbir Puar’s theorization of political assemblage (2007), or Occupy, or \#BlackLivesMatter theories of decentralized and nonhierarchi- cal organizing.

 

The late ’80s is precisely the era in which we see the financialization of science in particular, when, as Melinda Coo- per has demonstrated, venture capitalists started funding scientific research largely based on its promise of deliverable goods that could be sold to a consumer culture being trained toward constantly upgradeable selves

Slime mold modeling in the service of capitalist technological innovation emphasizes efficiency, and its promise as projected by popular science media marvels at the alien intelligence of such a “primitive” species. The novelty of the story lies in the surprise humans have at nonhuman intelligence and how that intelligence can be harnessed to serve human interests. Such a relation reproduces a colonialist version of trans-species exchange and sustains fascination as a means of reinforcing human supremacy in species hierarchy. ^755f2a
