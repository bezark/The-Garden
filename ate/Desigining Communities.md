Think about what a community is 
Think about the size
The Culture
The Conduct

You need to be firm and flexible

Spectrum of commuinity
 People ACTIVELY invested like a familt <- -> Network light 
 
 How doe the power structure work within your community?
 And theory vs practical
 Don't be affraid of hierarchies because they are necessary on a level to create things
 So think very critically about autonomy and agencency within your community itself

 Think about the ideal size of the community
 how do people engage with one another?
 How easily can people move in and out of community
 
 What sort of level of investment do you expect from each member
 
 Setting clear boundaries for the size of the community and the boudaries for the community
 
 Code of Conducts are a thing
 
 Perhaps not necessary, but protocols are.
 
 The question is how is accountability maintained- there will be a certain level of policing and boundaries
 	Restorative Justice practices etc
	Bring in people who know how to facitlitate this
	Like Pablo!
Have advisors and poeple who can consult honestly
 
 
 Be very careful about accountability- there must be accountability but it shouldn't mimic colonial structures
 
 being very candid
 
 "People speak different languages even if you're both speaking english"
 
 Community design *can't* be an after thought becuase it will design itself in the absence of designers
 
 **Smallness** is not bad- it can be really really nice to have a nice small community. 
 
 You  HAVE to trade things off when you scale up.
