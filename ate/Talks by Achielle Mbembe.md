I found these talks completely staggering. I found Achille to be SUCH a charismatic speaker and the points he made about the way he distinctly saw the world shifting were really impactful. There was a totality of vision that he had? Or rather, he saw the big picture in a way that really brought all these different systems together. I am going to be rewatching these for some time.

The notion that there is a major shift in our epistemological frameworks feels really right. Particularly the notions that Cartesian Objectivity is breaking down and that there exponential growth is happening in the realm of non-human cognition- the whole idea that we are undergoing an ontological shift in our conception of numbers was a gob-smacker. All of this was deeply impactful.

It also revealed to me a real blind spot I've had about machine learning- I have previously written off machine learning because I assumed that datasets trained on historical data could only perpetuate oppressive systems. While I still believe that is true, I have essentially denied the nonhuman cognition happening in the field of Machine Learning any agency- I have supplanted their imagination for the capitalism and tech bros that fueled their invention. This by extension points to something more basic that is actually happening: I am afraid to extend cognition beyond the bounds of the human. I am afraid to really open up my imagination to the fact that cognition does not need to be relegated entirely to the human form and I am afraid to grant 'tools' that sort of agency. ^ee5032

This is a big deal because there are in fact MANY SYSTEMS capable of cognition and memories and experiences do not need to be processed in a human brain, and there is so much to be gained by  taking a broader view of agency and intelligence. 

I found this work really meaningful and reaffirming of my purpose- to work to re-imagine my sense of time and space- to work to de-center my self and my humanness and replace it with a larger view of systems and processes.
