[School for Poetic Computation](https://sfpc.io/)

The School for Poetic Computation is organized around exploring the creative and expressive nature of computational approaches to art and design. The school approaches writing code like creative writing â€” focusing on the mechanics of programming, the demystification of tools, and hacking the conventions of art-making with computation.
