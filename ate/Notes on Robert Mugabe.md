[[ATE Reflections on Robert Mugabe]]

[Robert Mugabe - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe) [[Obsidian-Highlights]]

**Robert Gabriel Mugabe**

was a [Zimbabwean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe) revolutionary and politician who served as [Prime Minister of Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Zimbabwe) from 1980 to 1987 and then as [President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Zimbabwe) from 1987 to 2017

during the 1970s and 1980s he identified as a [Marxist–Leninist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist%E2%80%93Leninist), and as a [socialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism) after the 1990s.

Angered by [white minority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people_in_Zimbabwe) rule of his homeland within the [British Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire), Mugabe embraced [Marxism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism) and joined African nationalists calling for an independent state controlled by the black majority.

was convicted of [sedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedition) and imprisoned between 1964 and 1974. On release, he fled to [Mozambique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique), established his leadership of ZANU, and oversaw its role in the [Rhodesian Bush War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodesian_Bush_War), fighting [Ian Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Smith)'s predominately white government.

In the [1980 general election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_Southern_Rhodesian_general_election), Mugabe led ZANU-PF to victory, becoming Prime Minister when the country, now renamed Zimbabwe, gained internationally recognised independence later that year.

expanded healthcare and education and—despite his professed desire for a [socialist society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_mode_of_production)

—adhered largely to [mainstream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_economics), conservative economic policies.

Mugabe's calls for racial reconciliation failed to stem growing white emigration, while relations with [Joshua Nkomo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Nkomo)'s [Zimbabwe African People's Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe_African_People%27s_Union) (ZAPU) also deteriorated

[Gukurahundi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gukurahundi) of 1982–1987, Mugabe's [Fifth Brigade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwean_Fifth_Brigade) crushed ZAPU-linked opposition in [Matabeleland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matabeleland) in a campaign that killed at least 10,000 people,

chaired the [Non-Aligned Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Aligned_Movement) (1986–89), the [Organisation of African Unity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_African_Unity) (1997–98), and the [African Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Union) (2015–16). Pursuing [decolonisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decolonisation), Mugabe emphasised the [redistribution of land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_reform_in_Zimbabwe) controlled by white farmers to landless blacks, initially on a "willing seller–willing buyer" basis. Frustrated at the slow rate of redistribution, from 2000 he encouraged black Zimbabweans to violently seize white-owned farms.

Food production was severely impacted, leading to famine, economic decline, and Western sanctions.

Opposition to Mugabe grew, but he was re-elected in [2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Zimbabwean_presidential_election), [2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Zimbabwean_general_election), and [2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Zimbabwean_general_election) through campaigns dominated by violence,

Critics accused Mugabe of being a dictator responsible for [economic mismanagement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) and widespread [corruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_Zimbabwe), [anti-white racism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_Zimbabwe), and [human rights abuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Zimbabwe), including [crimes against humanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity).

They had been trained in their professions by the [Jesuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Jesus),

Mugabe's paternal grandfather was [Chief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chieftain) Constantine Karigamombe, alias "Matibiri", a powerful figure who served King [Lobengula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobengula) in the 19th century

The Jesuits were strict disciplinarians and under their influence Mugabe developed an intense self-discipline,[(4)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeredith200219-4) while also becoming a devout Catholic.

Father Jerome O'Hea, who welcomed the return of the Mugabe family to Kutama.[(10)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlair200218-10) In contrast to the racism that permeated Southern Rhodesian society, under O'Hea's leadership the Kutama Mission preached an ethos of racial equality.

As well as helping provide Mugabe with a Christian education, O'Hea taught him about the [Irish War of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_War_of_Independence), in which Irish revolutionaries had overthrown the British imperial regime.

he did not participate in the country's [1948 general strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_in_Southern_Rhodesia)

he joined the [African National Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress) youth league (ANCYL)[(28)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTESmithSimpson198117Norman200817-28) and attended [African nationalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_nationalism) meetings, where he met a number of Jewish South African [communists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism) who introduced him to [Marxist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism) ideas.[(29)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTESmithSimpson198116Meredith200222-29) He later related that despite this exposure to Marxism, his biggest influence at the time were the actions of [Mahatma Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi) during the [Indian independence movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement).

Mugabe returned to Southern Rhodesia in 1952,[(33)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlair200219Meredith200223-33) by which time—he later related— he was "completely hostile to the [colonialist] system".

He joined a number of inter-racial groups, such as the [Capricorn Africa Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capricorn_Africa_Society), through which he mixed with both black and white Rhodesians.

In Northern Rhodesia, he was taken in for a time by the family of [Emmerson Mnangagwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmerson_Mnangagwa), whom Mugabe inspired to join the liberation movement and who would later go on to be [President of Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Zimbabwe).

"I went [to Ghana] as an adventurist. I wanted to see what it would be like in an independent African state"

Mugabe later claimed that it was in Ghana that he finally embraced Marxism.

While Mugabe was teaching abroad, an anti-colonialist African nationalist movement was established in Southern Rhodesia

Having become a much-respected figure through his profession, his possession of three degrees, and his travels abroad, Mugabe was among those invited to speak to the crowd

He chaired the first NDP congress, held in October 1960, assisted by [Chitepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitepo) on the procedural aspects. Mugabe was elected the party's publicity secretary.

Mugabe consciously injected emotionalism into the NDP's African nationalism, hoping to broaden its support among the wider population by appealing to traditional cultural values

NDP Youth Wing and encouraged the incorporation of ancestral prayers, traditional costume, and female [ululation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ululation) into its meetings

Nkomo agreed to a proposal which would allow the black population representation through 15 of the 65 seats in the country's parliament. Mugabe and others in the NDP were furious at Nkomo's compromise.

Southern Rhodesia's African nationalist movement fell into disarray.[(61)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeredith200228-61) Mugabe spoke at a number of NDP rallies before the party was banned by the government in December 1961.

Mugabe appointed as ZAPU's publicity secretary and general secretary

Mugabe deemed such conflict a necessary tactic in the overthrow of British colonial dominance and white minority rule. This contrasted with Nkomo's view that African nationalists should focus on international diplomacy to encourage the British government to grant their demands

The rise of African nationalism generated a white backlash in Southern Rhodesia,

The new government sought to preserve white minority rule by tightening security and establishing full independence from the United Kingdom

it was time to move towards armed resistance

ZAPU and ZANU violently opposed one another and soon gang warfare broke out between their rival memberships.

Mugabe was arrested on his return to Southern Rhodesia in December 1963

There, forty prisoners were divided among four communal cells, with many sleeping on the concrete floor due to overcrowding;[(87)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTESmithSimpson198156-87) Mugabe shared his cell with Sithole, [Enos Nkala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enos_Nkala), and [Edgar Tekere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Tekere).[(88)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeredith200234-88) He remained there for eight years, devoting his time to reading and studying

Fearing that the guerrilla war would spread south, the South African government pressured Rhodesia to advance the process of détente with the politically moderate black governments of Zambia and Tanzania

After almost eleven years of imprisonment, Mugabe was released in November 1974

It would be almost a year before Machel accepted Mugabe's leadership of ZANU

By mid-1976, he had secured the allegiance of ZANLA's military commanders and established himself as the most prominent guerrilla leader battling Smith's regime.

During the war, Mugabe remained suspicious of many of ZANLA's commanders and had a number of them imprisoned

In 1977 he imprisoned his former second-in-command, [Wilfred Mhanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wilfred_Mhanda&action=edit&redlink=1), for suspected disloyalty

Mugabe focused on the propaganda war, making regular speeches and radio broadcasts.[(107)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlair200223-107) In these, he presented himself as a [Marxist-Leninist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism-Leninism), speaking warmly of Marxist-Leninist revolutionaries like [Vladimir Lenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin), [Joseph Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin), and [Fidel Castro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro).[(115)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlair200224-115) Despite his Marxist views, Mugabe's meetings with Soviet representatives were unproductive, for they insisted on Nkomo's leadership of the revolutionary struggle.

His relationship with the People's Republic of China was far warmer, as the Chinese Marxist government supplied ZANLA with armaments without any conditions

Mugabe called for the overthrow of Rhodesia's predominately white government, the execution of Smith and his "criminal gang", the expropriation of white-owned land, and the transformation of Rhodesia into a [one-party Marxist state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_state).[(126)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeredith20027-126) He repeatedly called for violence against the country's white minority,[(127)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlair200211-127) referring to white Rhodesians as "blood-sucking exploiters", "sadistic killers", and "hard-core racists"

Let us hammer [the white man] to defeat. Let us blow up his citadel. Let us give him no time to rest. Let us chase him in every corner. Let us rid our home of this settler vermin

For Mugabe, armed struggle was an essential part of the establishment of a new state

Mugabe opposed a negotiated settlement with Smith's government

At the [Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1979](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Heads_of_Government_Meeting_1979), held in Lusaka, the British Prime Minister [Margaret Thatcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher) surprised delegates by announcing that the UK would officially recognise the country's independence if it transitioned to democratic majority rule

Nkomo wanted to present himself as a moderate while Mugabe played up to his image as a Marxist revolutionary, with Carington exploiting this division.[(140)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHolland200861-140) Throughout the negotiations, Mugabe did not trust the British and believed that they were manipulating events to their own advantage

The agreement also ensured that the country's white minority retained many of its economic and political privileges,[(144)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTETendi2011313-144) with 20 seats to be reserved for whites in the new Parliament

Mugabe agreed to the protection of the white community's privately owned property on the condition that the UK and U.S governments provide financial assistance allowing the Zimbabwean government to purchase much land for redistribution among blacks

Attempting to calm panic and prevent white flight, Mugabe appeared on television and called for national unity, stability, and law and order, insisting that the pensions of white civil servants would be guaranteed and that private property would be protected

ZANU–PF's absolute parliamentary majority allowed them to rule alone, but Mugabe created a government of national unity by inviting members of rival parties to join his cabinet.

As Prime Minister, Mugabe retained Walls as the head of the armed forces

Mugabe's government continued to make regular pronouncements about converting Zimbabwe into a socialist society, but did not take concrete steps in that direction.

In contrast to Mugabe's talk of socialism, his government's budgetary policies were conservative, operating within a capitalist framework and emphasising the need for foreign investment

Mugabe sought a gradual transformation away from capitalism and tried to build upon existing state institutions

Under Mugabe's leadership, there was a massive expansion in education and health spending

During that period, the adult literacy rate rose from 62% to 82%, one of the highest levels in Africa.[(184)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlair200237-184) Levels of child immunisation were raised from 25% of the population to 92%

Growing corruption among the socio-economic elite generated resentment among the wider population

ANU–PF also began establishing its own business empire

At independence, 39% of Zimbabwe's land was under the ownership of around 6000 white large-scale commercial farmers, while 4% was owned by black small-scale commercial farmers, and 41% was 'communal land' where 4 million people lived, often in overcrowded conditions.[(190)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeredith2002120-190) The Lancaster House agreement ensured that until 1990, the sale of land could only take place on a "willing seller-willing buyer" basis. The only permitted exceptions were if the land was "underutilised" or needed for a public purpose, in which case the government could compulsorily purchase it while fully compensating the owner.[(191)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeredith2002119-191) This meant that Mugabe's government was largely restricted to purchasing land which was of poor quality.[(191)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeredith2002119-191) Its target was to resettle 18,000 black families on 2.5 million acres of white-owned land over three years. This would cost £30 million (US$60 million), half of which was to be provided by the UK government as per the Lancaster House Agreement.[(190)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeredith2002120-190)

Mugabe initially emphasised racial reconciliation and he was keen to build a good relationship with white Zimbabweans.[(194)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlair200214Meredith200241-194) He hoped to avoid a white [exodus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emigration) and tried to allay fears that he would nationalise white-owned property

In the economic boom that followed, the white minority—which controlled considerable property and dominated commerce, industry, and banking—were the country's main beneficiaries.

Nevertheless, many white Zimbabweans complained that they were the victims of [racial discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_discrimination).[(200)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeredith200250-200) Many whites remained uneasy about living under the government of a black Marxist and they also feared that their children would be unable to secure jobs.

He criticised "reactionary and counter-revolutionary elements" in the white community, stating that despite the fact that they had faced no punishment for their past actions, they rejected racial reconciliation and "are acting in collusion with South Africa to harm our racial relations, to destroy our unity, to sabotage our economy, and to overthrow the popularly elected government I lead

Their case generated an international outcry, which Mugabe criticised, stating that the case only gained such attention because the accused were white

Likening Nkomo to "a cobra in the house", Mugabe sacked him from the government, and ZAPU-owned businesses, farms, and properties were seized

These dissidents received support from South Africa through its [Operation Mute](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Operation_Mute&action=edit&redlink=1), by which it hoped to further destabilise Zimbabwe

the [Fifth Brigade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwean_Fifth_Brigade), an elite armed force trained by the North Koreans;

Interrogation centres were established where people were tortured.[(231)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeredith200270-231) Mugabe acknowledged that civilians would be persecuted in the violence, claiming that "we can't tell who is a dissident and who is not"

The Fifth Brigade closed all stores, halted all deliveries, and imposed a curfew, exacerbating starvation for a period of two months.

[Margaret Thatcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher)'s UK government was aware of the killings but remained silent on the matter, cautious not to anger Mugabe and threaten the safety of white Zimbabweans.[(241)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHolland200866Tendi2011308%E2%80%93309-241) The United States also did not raise strong objections, with President [Ronald Reagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan) welcoming Mugabe to the [White House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House) in September 1983.[(242)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlair200234-242) In October 1983, Mugabe attended the [Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Heads_of_Government_Meeting_1983) in [New Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi), where no participating states mentioned the Gukurahundi.[(242)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlair200234-242) In 2000, Mugabe acknowledged that the mass killings had happened, stating that it was "an act of madness ... it was wrong and both sides were to blame".[(243)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeredith200274-243) His biographer [Martin Meredith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Meredith) argued that Mugabe and his ZANU–PF were solely to blame for the massacres.[(243)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeredith200274-243) Various Mugabe biographers have seen the Gukurahundi as a deliberate attempt to eliminate ZAPU and its support base to advance his desire for a ZANU–PF one-party state.[(244)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlair200232Meredith200274-244)

There was further violence in the build-up to the 1985 election, with ZAPU supporters facing harassment from [ZANU–PF Youth League](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ZANU%E2%80%93PF_Youth_League&action=edit&redlink=1) brigades.[(245)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeredith200271-245) Despite this intimidation, ZAPU won all 15 of the parliamentary seats in Matabeleland.[(245)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeredith200271-245) Mugabe then appointed [Enos Nkala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enos_Nkala) as the new police minister. Nkala subsequently detained over 100 ZAPU officials, including five of its MPs and the Mayor of Bulawayo, banned the party from holding rallies or meetings, closed all of their offices, and dissolved all of the district councils that they controlled.[(246)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeredith200271%E2%80%9373-246) To avoid further violence, in December 1987 Nkomo signed a Unity Accord in which ZAPU was officially disbanded and its leadership merged into ZANU–PF.[(247)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlair200234Meredith200273Norman200879-247) The merger between the two parties left ZANU–PF with 99 of the 100 seats in parliament,[(248)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlair200236Meredith200279-248) and established Zimbabwe as a de facto one-party state.[(242)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlair200234-242)

In late 1987, Zimbabwe's parliament amended the constitution.[(249)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlair200236-249) On 30 December it declared Mugabe to be executive President, a new position that combined the roles of head of state, head of government, and commander-in-chief of the armed forces.[(250)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeredith200279Norman200880-250) This position gave him the power to dissolve parliament, declare [martial law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law), and run for an unlimited number of terms.[(251)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeredith200279-251) According to Meredith, Mugabe now had "a virtual stranglehold on government machinery and unlimited opportunities to exercise patronage

In the build-up to the 1990 election, parliamentary reforms increased the number of seats to 120; of these, twenty were to be appointed by the President and ten by the Council of Chiefs.[(254)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlair200236Meredith200289-254) This measure made it more difficult for any opposition to Mugabe to gain a parliamentary majority

Following the collapse of the Marxist-Leninist regimes in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, in 1991 ZANU–PF removed references to "Marxism-Leninism" and "[scientific socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_socialism)" in its material; Mugabe maintained that "socialism remains our sworn ideology"

That year, Mugabe pledged himself to free market economics and accepted a [structural adjustment programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_adjustment_programme) provided by the [International Monetary Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund)

This economic reform package called for Zimbabwe to privatise state assets and reduce import tariffs;[(184)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlair200237-184) Mugabe's government implemented some but not all of its recommendations

The US, UK, [International Monetary Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund), and [World Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank) threatened that if Zimbabwe implemented the law, it would forfeit foreign aid packages

a newspaper investigation found that not all of this was redistributed to landless blacks; much of the expropriated land was being leased to ministers and senior officials such as [Witness Mangwede](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Witness_Mangwede&action=edit&redlink=1), who was leased a 3000-acre farm in [Hwedza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwedza).[(270)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeredith2002126%E2%80%93127Norman2008127%E2%80%93128-270) Responding to this scandal, in 1994 the UK government—which had supplied £44 million for land redistribution—halted its payments

o house his family, Mugabe then built a new mansion at [Borrowdale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borrowdale,_Harare).[(276)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeredith2002109-276) In the [1995 parliamentary election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_Zimbabwean_parliamentary_election)

—which saw a low turnout of 31.7%—ZANU–PF gained 147 out of 150 seats.[(263)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlair200238-263) Following the election, Mugabe expanded his cabinet from 29 to 42 ministers while the government adopted a 133% pay rise for MPs.

Mugabe increasingly blamed the country's economic problems on Western nations and the white Zimbabwean minority, who still controlled most of its commercial agriculture, mines, and manufacturing industry

He revived the regular use of revolutionary rhetoric and sought to reassert his credentials as an important revolutionary leade

Mugabe also developed a growing preoccupation with homosexuality, lambasting it as an "un-African" import from Europe

Mugabe began to believe that there was a "gay mafia" and that all of his critics were homosexuals

Critics also accused Mugabe of using [homophobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia) to distract attention from the country's problems.

Some of Mugabe's colleagues described the invasions as retribution for the white community's alleged involvement in securing the success of the 'no' vote in the recent referendum.

Mugabe justified the seizures by the fact that this land had been seized by white settlers from the indigenous African population in the 1890s

He portrayed the invasions as a struggle against colonialism and alleged that the UK was trying to overthrow his government.

In May 2000, he issued a decree under the Presidential Powers (Temporary Measures) Act which empowered the government to seize farms without providing compensation, insisting that it was the British government that should make these payments.

In November 2001, Mugabe issued a presidential decree permitting the expropriation of virtually all white-owned farms in Zimbabwe without compensation.

A large number of the seized farms remained empty, while many of those redistributed to black peasant-farmers were unable to engage in production for the market because of their lack of access to fertiliser

as a [populist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism) movement that was "marked by ideological simplicity, emptiness, vagueness, imprecision, and multi-class character",[(439)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTENdlovu-Gatsheni20091141-439) further noting that it was "a broad church"

consistently railed against [imperialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism) and [colonialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism).[(442)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTENdlovu-Gatsheni20091143-442) He also argued that it was a form of [nativism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nativism_(politics)),[(443)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTENdlovu-Gatsheni20091146%E2%80%931147-443) which was permeated by a strong "cult of victimisation" in which a binary view was propagated where Africa was a "victim" and the [West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world) was its "tormentor"

"amabhunu

/Boers", thus enabling their removal from their land

Mugabe's party accorded that role to the rural peasantry.[(342)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOnslowRedding200969-342) As a result of this pro-rural view, they argued, Mugabe and the ZANU–PF demonstrated an anti-urban bias.

Tekere claimed that for Mugabe, Marxism-Leninism was "just rhetoric" with "no genuine vision or belief behind it"

Once in office he became a capitalist".[(448)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mugabe#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHolland200865-448) Mugabe has stated that "[socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism) has to be much more [Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity) than [capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism)"

an obsession with a perceived British threat to re-colonise Zimbabwe, to transfer the land controlled by white farmers to the black population, and issues of belonging and patriotism

Mugabe was determined to "take advantage of the past in order to secure a firm grip on national security

"Mugabe's collected writings amount to nothing more than crude [Marxism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism), couched in the ponderous English of the mission school", remarking that they were heavily informed by [Karl Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx), [Mao Zedong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong), and [Frantz Fanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frantz_Fanon), and displayed little originality
